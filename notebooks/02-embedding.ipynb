shantinagar - where his adopted son govinda  has become the pride and joy of the whole community. despite his own dark past, this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values. at this time, bhagwaan chances to rescue another naïve young man new to the big city – swaroop  – when shambu dada’s gang steal all swaroop’s money. impressed with swaroop’s education as well as the similarity of situation to his own arrival in the city years before, bhagwaan takes the “innocent and simple” villager under his protective wing. he arranges a good job, even brings swaroop home to live with himself and his son, young govinda. swaroop and bhagwaan claim each other as ‘brothers’. one day on a roadway nearby the district, members of shambu dada’s gang assault a beautiful young woman whom shambu lusts after. swaroop hears her cries for help and tries to rescue her, believing as bhagwaan does that: “it is every man’s duty to honour and protect women.” but swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight. he is badly beaten by shambu’s men before bhagwaan can rescue him in turn. the young woman  who gives her name as bijli insists on tending the wounded swaroop who bravely tried to help her. bhagwaan invites bijli to come live at their house until she can find a place to stay. after some initial confusion when govinda mistakes bijli for his new ‘uncle’ swaroop’s wife, all four of them – bhagwaan, govinda, swaroop, and now bijli – live happily in bhagwaan’s modest home, govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between swaroop and bijli. however, what neither bhagwaan nor swaroop realise is that bijli is a streetwalker. intercepted on her way out to work one evening, bijli spills bhagwaan a yarn about how she is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute in order to arrest real prostitutes and their patrons. bhagwaan believes her. he preserves her ‘secret’, and all four continue happily in the house just as before, ignorance being bliss. the audience soon learn, though, that appearances are deceiving: bijli is not, actually, a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein she bilks potential ‘johns’ of money through clever ruses. meanwhile, shambu dada has sworn revenge against bhagwaan for foiling his plan to abduct bijli. after brutally beating to death one of his gangmembers who botched the abduction, shambu dumps the corpse in bhagwaan’s territory seeking to frame bhagwaan for the murder. the honest policeman inspector vijay , though, is fully aware of shambu dada’s crime empire activities as well as bhagwaan’s reformation. when bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder, inspector vijay not only fails to arrest bhagwaan but even introduces bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter – madhu  – who is researching crime trends in the city, and recommends that she visit shantinagar. the street-savvy bhagwaan helps inspector vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture shambu dada in possession of the murder weapon. shambu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. all seems well. bhagwaan invites madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in shantinagar. when young govinda mischievously invites bijli to garland his ‘uncle’ swaroop, we discover that the blushing swaroop hides a growing attraction to bijli. when madhu reciprocates bhagwaan’s invitation by inviting him and swaroop to her birthday party at a fancy hotel, bijli manages to talk her way along. after bijli’s comically jealous behaviour at the party, she confesses how she has come to love swaroop, just as he loves her. she tries to explain that no future is possible between them. but swaroop, ecstatic at learning his feelings are returned, simply won’t listen. unknown to all, however, the evil shambu dada has escaped during transfer between prison facilities. shambu vows to revenge himself upon bhagwaan at all costs. while warning bhagwaan of his danger at shambu’s escape, inspector vijay happens to mention that bijli is not, in fact, working for the police at all but has actually been arrested, if released, on suspicion of prostitution. bhagwaan angrily confronts bijli. devastated, bijli humbly confesses she lied about working with the police. bhagwaan strikes her and throws her out of the house … and the whole neighbourhood. when swaroop returns home he wants to support bijli but it is already too late: bijli is gone. all now seems lost for our lovers. but wait! a chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals bijli’s true story: she has nobly sacrificed her reputation in order to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of her sole surviving relative, a little sister, after the rest of their entire family were killed outright during the bhopal disaster.

6. on his third attempt with the rocket, he lights the fuse but it burns quickly and fires successfully out from under him before he could get ready and leaves wile floating in midair with a cloud of dust blocking his view below. unable to see what is below him, wile pokes his foot through the cloud and consequently suffers gravity for the sixth time, as he holds up a sign stating \"goodbye\" and then flipping to \"again\".  7. to get the bird to stick, wile leaves out a sheet of acme giant fly paper in the road and sits down on a rock, laughing at his \"genius\". he hears a braking noise, assumes the road runner has been caught, and leaps out to catch him, but instead of the road runner, he has caught an actual giant fly. the fly is very unhappy about being stuck on the paper and thus wraps the coyote with it, who tiptoes away from the scene. 8. on his final attempt at the skyrocket, wile e. accidentally ignites his tail instead of the fuse, and detects his mistake and leaps up in pain only to smash his head on another outcropping. fortunately, this causes him to return to the rocket and to light the fuse with his tail, and after it takes off is struggling briefly to get control then puts out the fire on his tail. unfortunately, the rocket is off target, and it bores through the cliff under the road runner, who allows the coyote to be humiliated privately. the rocket finally explodes, blackening the coyote and throwing him back into the air. displeased, wile e. holds up a yellow sign asking \"how did i ever get into this line of work?\" before falling for a seventh time. 9. a new plan is formulated, where wile e. attempts to blow up the road runner by pelting explosive tennis balls at him. the first ball seamlessly blows up a cactus with no issues , and the coyote is eager to try them at work. as luck would have it, the road runner is heard, and wile is quick to lob another ball at him, but just misses, and the ball then drops onto the arm of a cactus, which throws it directly back to its owner. a little agitated, the coyote returns the ball, and this time it is caught by power lines and slung back out of wile e.\\'s reach. the ball pops directly back into its original slot in the box of balls as wile e. arrives on the scene and takes stock. sensing the coming explosions, wile e. holds up a pair of signs: \"for sale one used tennis racket\" and \"cheap!\" before  a \"gigantic explosion!\" occurs. 10. the whole cartoon, however, is best known for its ending gag. wile e. coyote is chasing the road runner through a series of pipelines, which causes both of them to emerge in a greatly shrunken state. upon discovering their situation, they agree to re-enter the pipeline and be transformed back into full size. the road runner emerges at normal size, but wile is still in small size when he comes out. upon discovering this turn of fortune, the road runner stops and allows his rival to \"catch\" him. the coyote doesn\\'t notice anything until he steps over his opponent\\'s feet and rushes back to finally \"catch\" the road runner. the coyote is ecstatic and pulls out his knife and fork to eat his opponent...until he stares more closely at the bird\\'s huge legs, which are twice as tall as he is, and looks up to see he is massively outgunned. the road runner gives an amplified \"beep-beep\", causing wile to drop his utensils in shock. he can only hold up signs to the audience stating, \"okay, wise guys, you always wanted me to catch him -\" and \"now what do i do?\". well, that\\'s all folks!',\n",

       " 'the film is based rather loosely on the play, adds an entire backstory before o\\'neill\\'s actual play begins, and includes several new characters that do not appear in it . some people consider the movie to be just a vehicle for showing off robeson\\'s musical talent . however, the film does provide what may be robeson\\'s greatest dramatic performance in a movie, considered by many to be worthy of an oscar nomination that it did not receive. in the film version, the opening shots are of an african ritual dance. some critics are quick to assess the opening as representative of the \"primitive\" black world to which brutus jones will eventually revert. however, more scholarly-based reviews of the film understand the complexities of the allusion to and comparison between the roots of the african american church and the rhythmic chanting often seen in african religious practices. a quick dissolve takes us into a baptist church in the american south, where the dancing of the congregation presents an image that argues for a continuity between the \"savage\" africans and the ring-shout baptists. such suggestive editing may be the kind of element that causes viewers to suspect the film of racism. similarly, the film makes copious use of the word \"nigger\", as did o\\'neill\\'s original play. african americans criticized o\\'neill\\'s language at the time, so its preservation and expansion in the film present another cause for critique. given robeson\\'s subsequent career as a civil rights activist, the spectacle of his character using the term so frequently in regard to other blacks seems shocking today. as for the plot, brutus jones has just been hired as a pullman porter, a job that served the upward mobility of thousands of african american men in the first half of the twentieth-century. jones proudly shows off his uniform to his girlfriend dolly , setting up the contrast with the later scenes in which \"the emperor jones\" parades around in overdone military garb. but jones is quickly corrupted by the lures of the big city, taking up with fast women and gamblers. one boisterous crap game leads to a fight in which he inadvertently stabs jeff, the man who had introduced him to the fast-life and from whom he had stolen the affections of the beautiful undine . a stint on the chain gang allows the film its first opportunity to show robeson without his shirt on, an exposure of male nudity unusual for 1933 and certainly for a black actor. here and later the director plays on robeson\\'s sexual power and, implicitly, on cultural stereotypes about the libidinal power of black men. jones escapes the convict\\'s life after striking a white guard who was torturing and beating another prisoner. making his way home, he briefly receives the assistance of his wife before taking a job stoking coal on a steamer headed for the caribbean. one day, he catches sight of a remote island and jumps ship, swimming to the island. the island is under the crude rule of a top-hatted black despot who receives merchandise from smithers, the dilapidated white colonial merchant who is the sole caucasian on the island. jones rises to become smithers\\' partner and eventually \"emperor\". he dethrones his predecessor with a trick that allows him to survive what appears to be a fusillade of bullets, creating the myth that he can only be slain by a silver one. jones\\'s rule of the island involves increasing taxes on the poor natives and pocketing the proceeds. the highlight is a twenty-five minute spoken monologue taken directly from o\\'neill\\'s play, in which brutus jones , hunted by natives in revolt, flees through the jungle and slowly disintegrates psychologically, becoming a shrieking hysteric who runs right into the path of his pursuers.',\n",

       " 'it is new year\\'s day of 2006, more than a year after the events of night watch. anton gorodetsky, the protagonist of the first film, finds himself in the middle of an approaching conflict between the light and dark others, who are still bound with an uneasy truce. anton is still a night watch operative, now working with his trainee and romantic interest, svetlana. as his son yegor has now become a dark other, anton is forced to secretly destroy evidence of yegor\\'s attacks on normal people, which violates the treaty, leaving the night watch unable to sentence yegor. to redeem for his previous mistake, an attempt to use a witch\\'s service to kill the unborn yegor , anton seeks the legendary chalk of fate, a magical chalk that could rewrite history, which was once tamerlane\\'s property and one of the main reasons for his numerous military successes. meanwhile, zavulon, the leader of the dark others and their day watch, is waiting for yegor\\'s birthday. at the birthday, yegor would become a great other and acquire the power that would allow the dark others to break the treaty . zavulon\\'s gratitude to anton for covering yegor\\'s violations of the treaty doesn\\'t stop him and the day watch from attempting to frame anton for murder and bring him in front of the inquisition. they succeed, despite the efforts made by geser, the head of the night watch, to protect anton from the dark others by putting him in olga\\'s body. while in her body, svetlana confesses that she loves anton to the person she thinks is olga, which pushes their relationship forward. this happens despite svetlana\\'s initial anger at anton for not telling her that he was in olga\\'s body. anton obtains the chalk of fate from its hiding place in a central asian cafe in moscow and uses it to summon yegor. they initially get on well, but yegor is resentful when anton refuses his request to patch things up with yegor\\'s mother. anton puts his large coat on yegor, who seems to be cold, and leaves to order food. at this time, svetlana rings anton\\'s mobile, which he left in the pocket of the coat, and yegor, angry at her intrusion into his relationship with his absentee father, yells at her, \"he has a family. don\\'t call again.\" he smashes the phone and leaves with the chalk, which he takes to zavulon. zavulon cannot use or even touch the chalk, because doing so would be a direct violation of the treaty, so he has yegor give it to his minion/lover alisia to do with as she wishes, although it is implied that zavulon knows what she will do with it. yegor\\'s birthday party begins soon after that; the guests are dark others , although anton makes his way to the party as yegor\\'s father to expose the real perpetrator of the murder he has been charged with - his vampire neighbor, kostya\\'s father. he is unable, however, to avert a disaster: as svetlana rushes to the party to find anton, yegor confronts her. she tries to avoid a conflict but yegor repeatedly challenges her and expresses resentment at her relationship with his father; svetlana accidentally strikes yegor and spills a drop of his blood, which zavulon interprets as a violation of the treaty and thus uses as a pretense to declare all-out war on the light others. yegor, now a great other, unleashes an apocalypse upon moscow, killing most of the guests and blinding svetlana. the city is nearly destroyed, starting with the ostankino tower; a fierce battle between the light and dark others follows, with few survivors on either side. in the midst of the chaos, anton, who survives, finds alisia who is trying to revive her dead lover, kostya, but without success. she cannot revive him because her actions did not cause his death. the scene implies the user of the chalk can only change decisions that he or she made, not anyone else\\'s. anton convinces alisia to give him the chalk so that he can prevent the destruction of moscow and the deaths of scores of others, but is almost immediately caught by a panicked svetlana and an enraged yegor. the two great others fight for anton, but nearly kill him in the process. saved at the last minute by geser, anton runs through the ruins of moscow to the house where he, fourteen years ago, made his visit to the witch &mdash; the visit that caused the entire sequence of events, starting anton\\'s own initiation into the night watch. anton writes no  on a wall in this house. moscow reverts to its normal, undemolished state and the film returns to 1992 and the first scene of night watch. in the epilogue, as a result of the chalk\\'s influence, anton rethinks his deal with the witch, and therefore never inadvertently agrees to harm his wife\\'s unborn child, who would have been yegor. he walks out of the house and into the street, where he meets svetlana. zavulon and geser watch them from a park bench, eager to see if anton will recognize svetlana, despite now having never met her because of the rewriting of history. geser\\'s prediction turns out to be accurate; despite not knowing how or why, anton recognizes svetlana and they walk off together, implicitly striking up a less harried relationship than the one they have/had in the first film.',\n",

       " 'ninja resurrection takes place in the tokugawa era, at a time when christians in japan were being persecuted. the leader of the shimabara rebellion, amakusa shirō, hoped to resist the government forces attacking christians like him but is assassinated. soon after, amakusa\\'s restless spirit returns to avenge his fallen comrades and is up to yagyū jūbei mitsuyoshi to put a stop to the demonic onslaught.  jubei\\'s revenge begins a narration of the timepiece explaining the era, the war between toyotomi and tokugawa, the events that led up to the shimabara rebellion, and a dark satanic prophecy about shiro. along with the narration there are japanese paintings of these events. the first ova called \"the cant of hell\" shows a small band of soldiers raiding a village outside of harano castle, and smashing a statue of madonna. all the villagers hide except for a little boy who they shoot. after the soldiers leave to report the christian rebels to the shogun, a small girl named \\'ocho\\' runs to the boy\\'s body and begs him to wake up. the boy, who is shiro, miraculously revives and shows the approaching villagers that the bullet hit a crucifix he had. sunlight shines through the clouds onto shiro and he raises the crucifix and a long beam of light shoots from it up into the sky. the villagers bowdown and worship shiro and declare him to be \\'tenshi\\', the son of jehovah and the returned messiah and their saviour. the madonna statue reforms. an evil-looking man in the bushes watches the events as they unfold and smiles. 55 years later, an army of government soldiers attack harano castle in a fog but are killed by an onslaught of arrows. inside the castle, the evil-looking man, who is revealed to be \\'soy kanmoiri\\', gives a speech declaring their victory against the heretics. the christians boisterously support him and declare that as long as they have lord shiro they will kill the tokugawa and make all the lands christian. after the speech, lord shiro speaks privately to soy, informing him that the food supply exhausted two days ago and they were fighting on mere willpower. he opts to use the recent advantage to surrender himself in exchange for the lives of his people, but soy says no and that he must have faith and that if they lose faith now then all they believed in would be a lie. shiro tells soy they can\\'t win the war and everyone will die. elsewhere, general nobutsuna matsudaira speaks with his commanders about the recent defeat. he is told that more than 500 were killed. nobutsuna recognizes that the christians are using black magic. jubei arrives and tells nobutsuna that the army will not breech the wall and he has a plan. jubei then swiftly leaves. 5 months earlier the shogun had sent an army of 100,000 men to defeat the christians, whom had attacked and seized harano castle. the shogun, outraged that his army was defeated by peasants and farmers, sent nobutsuna matsudaira to destroy the christians by any means. nobutsuna orders all his men to attack the castle anyway. miyamoto musashi observes the army moving-out, from a faraway cliff. he declares that the army will not be able to penetrate and the men are being sacrificed uselessly. he then runs to join the army but sees a massive kite in the sky and comments on the ingenuity of this new approach. the extremely huge kite, tethered to someplace, floats high in the clouds above harano castle. jubei and four other ninjas are standing on a narrow platform on the kite. they leap from the platform through a lightningstorm and float down to the castle using capes. using the aerial assault, jubei and his four ninjas enter the castle and begin easily slicing the christians in half. one ninja in particular who has a penchant for explosives detonates a wave of explosions throughout the castle. there is intense fighting with lots of blood. nobutsuna\\'s army uses a battering-ram to enter the castle, and the soldiers battle their enemies. shiro gathers the women, kids, and old people into a part of the castle that the soldiers can\\'t enter because it is protected by a seal. he promises to protect them with the power of god. however, the four ninjas know about this seal and the four barriers that are maintaining the seal. each one destroys a barrier. shiro is alerted to the destruction of the seal. shiro senses jubei and refers to him as a \"mighty power that will kill us\". jubei slices a bunch of men and then comes across two kids whom he wall-runs past. the kids tell soy, who smiles and slashes them. jubei meets shiro on a roof and shiro bargains with him to spare the lives of the women and children if he commits seppuku. shiro takes a tanto to kill himself but is stopped by soy who shows him the decapitated heads of the two kids and tells him not to trust jubei. shiro goes ballistic and uses his magic to summon a lot of power into himself. he then uses the power of psychokinesis to destroy the roof and fire the tanto and shingles at jubei. shiro then summons a black dragon with which he attacks jubei. miyamoto, who has entered the castle, is easily slicing through christian soldiers as he watches the events. jubei tries to slice the dragon in half but it proves useless. he then flees but the dragon catches up to him. he holds on to the snout of the dragon as it flies through buildings and into the sky. shiro emerges from the top of the dragon\\'s head and begins strangling jubei. two of the ninjas try to assist jubei by firing harpoons at the dragon but it breaks free. the biggest and strongest of the ninjas tells those two to stay put. he and the ninja who likes explosives perform a tactical attack. the ninja who likes explosives, opens up a bazooka and fires it at the dragon but it has little effect. the tall ninja, who attacks from a different angle, extends a folding metal suit of armour over his body, originating from two small shoulder pads. the armor gives him rocket propulsion and he flies into the dragon, causing massive damage. jubei cuts off shiro\\'s hands and falls to earth. the dragon\\'s head is still alive and sneaks up behind jubei. jubei holds up the children\\'s heads and hesitates shiro mid-attack. he then throws his sword at shiro, spearing him in the chest. the impact rips shiro from the dragon\\'s head and flings him into a window of the main chapel. the tall ninja lands and his armour folds back up into his shoulder pads.  the second ova is called \"hell\\'s spawn\". it begins by showing a younger jubei kill five samurai with ease. jubei\\'s father, munenori yagyu, scolds him for his constant murders but jubei makes excuses. munenori challenges jubei to a duel; warning him that he will not hesitate just because jubei is his son. jubei attacks but restrains himself and only slashes munenori\\'s shirt. munenori jumps into the air and tosses a kunai into jubei\\'s eye. as jubei stays bleeding, his father states that he knew jubei would not attack him and used this knowledge against jubei. munenori tells jubei that he must never lose and should exploit every weakness of his opponent and that he can\\'t rely on strength alone. jubei tells his father that he doesn\\'t need his father\\'s platitudes and that he is stronger than his father ever would be. munenori banishes jubei from his house and lands. there is a historical narration about the strongest swordsmen of the time and how swordmanship became a science and evolved. the samurai\\'s discussed are musashi miyamoto, mataemon araki, inshun hosowei, botaro tamiya, munenori yagyu, and jubei yagyu. it states that their battles are legendary but their deaths are shrouded in mystery; for example, musashi disappeared in foggy mountains and mataemon was poisoned by an unknown person. several months after the shimabara riot, jubei is resting under a tree when he starts to have memories of the riot and all the bodies. an old man is riding into the yagyu lands when he spots a boy and a girl spear-fishing. the girl keeps nagging the boy and he dunks her into the water. the old man rides on towards the yagyu estate. the girl jumps onto jubei and pretends to be frighten of a snake. she then confesses how much she likes jubei. when the old man, whose name is jushin sagoguichi, enters the estate he is dismayed that it is in ruin and that some walls are broken down. a servant tells him that lord jubei allowed it to get that way. jubei and the two children arrive and it turns out that jushin is the children\\'s father. inside the house, jushin scolds his daughter for not being lady-like and scolds his son, who is his heir, for doing servant\\'s chores. jubei tries to calm him down with sake. another young girl, named ohina, enters the room bringing food. she speaks graciously to lord jushin and jushin compliments her on how beautiful she has become since he last saw her. as jushin and jubei eat, jushin tells them that the shogun, yorinobu, has requested that all unmarried girls of noble birth between the ages of 15-23 should be brought to kishu. jubei finds the mandate strange. onwei, jushin\\'s daughter, protests stating she wants to stay with jubei. jushin tells jubei that the shogun is amassing a large army and gathering lots of food and it looks like he is going to increase taxes. he also tells jubei that many strange men have been coming to the capital. jushin also tells jubei that many girls have gone missing. jubei invites jushin to watch the girls spar. in the morning, ohina demonstrates her skills with a naginata by defeating a lot of men in a sparring match. onwei then challenges ohina and the two battle to a standstill. jushin compliments them on their improvement and soon afterwards leaves with them to kishu. before onwei leaves, she reminds jubei to bathe at least once every three days and to wear clean clothes. as jubei watches them go, he tells his servant to send a spy to watch the castle in kishu and that he,jubei, would be gone for five days. somenight later, at shosetsu yui\\'s residence in edo, ohina is attacked and raped by a born-again inshun hosowei. as he slowly rapes her, he licks her breasts and plays around with her. after he is finished raping ohina, he kills her. mataemon araki, who is sitting nearby, comments on how inshun likes doing that. inshun retorts that mataemon does the same thing. as mataemon constantly stabs a kunai into his hand, he says that today he doesn\\'t feel like killing girls but wants to kill rats. the two men are being spied on by a ninja. mataemon suddenly leaps into the trees and slowly kills the ninja. two more ninjas attack him. he kills one and chases the other. the ninja flees across rooftops but mataemon is faster than him. mataemon calls the ninja a mouse. the ninja calls up other ninjas to assist him. mataemon tells them his name and how it has been a while since he killed a man. the ninjas believe he is lying about his identity. mataemon removes the scarf covering the lower half of his face and tells them he is \"a born again\". the ninja tells him \"then you will die again\". all the ninjas attack him at once, impaling him on several swords. mataemon condescends the ninjas\\' futile attack. he pops the swords out of his body, along with his intestines. he then unsheathes his own sword and uses it along with his dangling intestines to attack and slay the shinobis. two shinobi escape him. one backs into a dark corner and is quickly sliced to pieces by a resurrected botaro tamiya. botaro tosses a dagger into the other ninja but he replaces himself with a cat. mataemon yells at botaro for ruining his fun. at tajima-no-kami yagyu residence, the ninja who survived, whose name is godaiyu, reports to munenori yagyu. he tells him that lord yorinobu in kishu is organizing an army of ronin and that inhuman creatures were appearing. he also tells munenori that he saw ghosts: mataemon, inshun, botaro. munenori doesn\\'t believe him and scolds him for drinking. he tells munenori he wasn\\'t drinking. munenori says that those men were some of the most skilled killers, and he ponders what shosetsu is planning. he then begins coughing uncontrollably. godaiyu says that jubei would be useful. munenori yells at him to never mention that name, and godaiyu apologises. munenori tells him to continue observing shosetsu, and godaiyu slides away into the darkness. jubei is walking through a fog in the woods when he comes upon a small hut. inside the hut, jubei talks to an old man about the prophecy of \\'tenshi\\'. the old man asks if jubei really believes in satan and reminds jubei that he saw shiro\\'s staked head. the old man informs jubei that he has people familiar with underground paths and will be able to use them in case of battle. the old man then tells jubei that jubei is too young to quit being a warrior. jubei tells him he is tired of murdering in the name of duty. the old man asks jubei how many persons he killed but jubei tells him that he lost count. the old man says that he should take a break and rest a little. the old man also says that jubei reminds him of an old friend named musashi miyamoto, who strove to excel everyone in swordmanship and now lives as a hermit in the mountains. as the old man talks to jubei, a little boy leaves musashi\\'s house thanking him for the lessons. musashi\\'s house is dug into the side of a mountain. inside is very spacious with large gigantic statues of numerous warriors. musashi recollects the shimabara revolt and watching jubei fight. he questions if he would be able to defeat jubei. musashi then picks up a paintbrush and begins tirelessly drawing a lot of buddhist pictures. later that night, in edo, during a full moon; soiken mori, shosetsu yui, botaro, inshun and mataemon, stand on an altar in a room, surrounding ocho who is laying down. they all start chanting \"satan\". a cloud blankets the moon, causing the room to darken. suddenly the moon turns red, the wind blows strongly, and electricity starts flashing within the room. shosetsu asks soiken what\\'s happening but soiken tells him to be silent. ocho starts levitating. her body starts convulsing wildly as her clothes fall off. suddenly, she exhales an enormous cloud of smog. the smog shapeshifts into a crucifix, then the virgin mary, then into the devil. after maintaining its devil form for a few moments, the smog then returns to ocho\\'s body. the men stand silently, staring at ocho. a big bulbous growth forms in ocho\\'s throat and crawls under her skin to her belly, where it turns into faces and then stretches and pulls ocho\\'s skin chaotically as it wriggles about. suddenly, many long strands of silver hair fire out of ocho\\'s body and wrap around wooden beams, bars, the ceiling, and even soiken\\'s and shosetsu\\'s necks. shosetsu tries to get it off but soiken tells him to leave it. as ocho is suspended upside-down, electrical charges flow through the hair. soiken calls for satan to come out and for shiro amakusa to come out. ten fingers push out of ocho\\'s mouth and wiggle about. then a long split cuts from inside her body and a naked, silver-haired shiro pushes his way out. as shiro forces his way out, he rips ocho into many pieces. the hair strands that kept ocho suspended, untangle and retreat to shiro as he lowers himself to the ground. shiro shrieks and green energy shoots from his body into the air and descends onto the three resurrecteds: botaro, mataemon, inshun. after charging-up, the four jump through the ceiling. the moon returns to normal. somewhere else, jubei is walking through the woods when suddenly there is a strong gust of wind which cuts his cheek, causing him to bleed. musashi is still drawing, when a sudden breeze blows out the candle. a drop of blood falls on his page. there is a street festival going on that night, with hundreds of people in attendance. botaro is standing in the crowd. he draws his sword and begins slicing randomly, cutting men, women and kids in half. as people start fleeing, mataemon races through the crowd, hacking people with his sword. inshun carries a staff with a boomerang blade on the top. he flings the blade into the air and it cuts through many people before returning to his staff. some persons try fleeing from the spinning blade but are too slow. shiro, who can use his hair for attacks, extends his hair to impale and slice-up persons. dozens of men, women and kids are killed and their bodies and heads staked for display. soiken laughs and declares that hell is unleashing its force. the show ends with the 4 resurrecteds jumping into the air one by

       " 'phir kabhi targets the heart of its audience. it is all about emotions. it is a sensitive tale of love . there are many moments in the film where one may realize the meaning behind the saying, crying while laughing and laughing also while crying. how both the phenomena happen together can be witnessed via few moments of this film. film rides over the successive sequences of light and sensitive scenes. at one moment something light, humorous and lively is happening on screen and a smile is flowing on the lips of the characters and audiences also and all of a sudden it’s followed by a very intense and sensitive sequence and not only characters pass through sad moments but audiences may also feel the impact of those onscreen happenings. those who want to see one of the best performances of mithun chakraborty, may watch the film for that purpose. new actors may learn from his performance, how to cover a vast range of emotions while playing a character. light and camera departments have performed very well. sound  though hears loud at some places. students of cinematography may watch the film for very good work performed by nataraja subramanian. cinematography is fascinating. one very attractive scene, he has captured, is where mithun and tinnu anand are shown standing at sea shore film swings between present, memories of the past and dreams of future and editor, mahesh narayan, has driven the vehicle of this mixing in such a smooth manner that eyes and attention of an audience may not even realize that a gear has been changed. a kind of perfection is there. this is not just another love story of senior citizens. it has its own merits. story may look familiar but expansion of the story through the events is interesting. a couple lives a married life together for 40–50 years and then one dies and leaves other to spend rest of the years of his/her life alone. one becomes habitual of other’s presence in every single minute of the life and all of a sudden that person is not here. person has gone but other person’s dependency on him/her has not been vanished. how to handle this loneliness? “death is quite an honest enemy, it does not accept friendship. it kills but it kills for once and all. loneliness is a fastidious enemy. one extends the hands of friendship towards it and it becomes more strangely stern in attitude. it kills one all the time again and again. it kills at home, at market place and it does not spare one at temples also. at an old age it becomes difficult to fight with the loneliness. an old train moves slowly and it follows the discipline of go-stop-go. it stops at such stations also where if one looks outside the window then he finds silence all over. if he gets a signal to go ahead a person goes ahead. “ mithun says abovementioned monologue before the mirror in his bedroom and film is based upon the meaning of this monologue. mithun will simply move the audience in the scene where he gets up early in the morning and finds a cigarette kept by his wife, rati agnihotri, on the side table of his bed. he leaves the bed, picks up the cigarette and calls for his wife. he is very happy. he is overwhelmed by the loving care which his wife showers upon him. he wants to share this happiness with his wife. everything is bringing a smile to the audience but after a few seconds only whole atmosphere is changed into a gloomy one and mithun had to create two exactly opposite atmospheres and he does this job very effectively. a terrific performance he has given in these moments and throughout the film he remains the main source from whom this film gets its maximum strength. he has created many very good moments in the film. another remarkable scene is where he is searching his watch and he forgets that rati is dead now and cries upon realizing it. his grand daughter comes there and he conceals his tears from her. another gem of a scene is where he tells kitu gidvani that he will not meet or write dimple ever. plot takes some inspiration from the mythological tale of radha and krishna. in short, mithun’s first love is dimple but situations separate them in school time only. later he marries rati and after her death only he again comes in contact with dimple. two old lovers, who are suffering from loneliness, try to search solace in each others company which is not initially acceptable to mithun’s daughter in law. an entire new generation remains devoid of the pleasure of writing and reading the letters and this film at least shows the use of this old and now obsolete but very good communication method. feelings may be conveyed by the email also but to read something in sender’s own hand writing certainly enhances the impact of the words. words carry more emotions through hand written letters than email or printed greeting cards. dimple kapadia adequately supports the film. so do gulshan grover and kittu gidvani. tinnu anand, his lambretta scooter and his self made cia theory all the three things are among the other attractive features of the film. rimoh chakraborty, plays the younger version of mithun’s character and he seems to inherit some good percentage of his father’s vast acting talent. he may carry mithun chakraborty’s flag ahead in the acting profession. the girl who has played the young version of dimple kapadia’s character, acted very well. rati agnihotri in a role consists of a few scenes only makes her presence noticeable. film has got some very good and meaningful dialogues. nishan pehchan to bata sakte hain, haalaat nahin. naram panee ke neeche itane sakht patthar kaise ho sakte hain ganga mere aur laxmi ke saath hamesha rahee par hamre beech kabhin nahin rahee tum hansaya na karo … tum dard chhipaya na karo film gives a best possible and a very beautiful tribute to dev/vijay anand’s classic film guide’s song aaj phir jeene ki tamannna hai. and what the heck, only shahrukh khans are not eligible to ride on a train in a true filmi manner, an aged lover, played by mithun chakraborty like veteran actor, can also do it and he can even handle the emotional scenes followed by this bravery with far more effectiveness! shantanu moitra recycles old tunes to create almost all the songs here though it feels good to listen one of the songs in bhupendra’s voice.',\n",

upon checking the body, they hear ernest valdemar’s voice coming from the still body claiming that his soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. valdemar tells them that he sees \"others\" in the dark void looking at him. while jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find robert talking to mr. valdemar’s undead corpse who tells him that the \"others\" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. valdemar tells robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. in a panic, jessica shoots valdemar’s corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. while robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, jessica goes back into the cellar only to find valdemar’s body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of \"the others\" to use him. jessica shoots him, but he keeps on coming. robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees jessica and valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead. robert finally tells valdemar that he’s going to wake him and free him from his hypnosis. but after doing so by counting to five, valdemar tells robert that it\\'s too late to wake him for without his body as a conduit, the others cannot return to their realm. \"they\\'re with you now!\" exclaims valdemar, who finally falls dead. robert then steals all the cash that jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house. robert goes back to his apartment in downtown pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. but then, the ghostly \"others\" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. the ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter robert\\'s dead body. several days later, the police led by detective grogan arrive at robert’s apartment to answer complaints about a \"strange smell\" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. but just then, the horribly decomposed body of robert, under the control of the others, appears and attacks grogan, telling him that there is nobody to wake him up. \"the black cat\" rod usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. a naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: \"still life’s my art,\" a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities -led by detective legrand- to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in pittsburgh where rod lives. after arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend annabel. rod and annabel’s relationship is uncomfortably distant. annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with annabel’s talk of witches and superstition. annabel, in contrast to rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life. over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by annabel’s excessive protection of it. driven to distraction by the cat’s apparent hatred of him, rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled metropolitan horrors, a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures. as annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a medieval pagan festival where he is executed for the murder of the cat. one day, when annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave rod, who at that very moment is in a local bar drinking heavily. rod becomes unnerved when the barmaid eleanora gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to annabel’s own cat. rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest . rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. but annabel intervenes and comes to the cat\\'s rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome and gory death when rod hacks her to death with a meat cleaver. after shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, mr. pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, rod assures him that nothing is wrong. confident that he can escape detection, rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain annabel’s disappearance to her music students, betty and christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. but after a confrontation with christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to rod about his story of annabel leaving him, he confides in mr. and mrs. pym about his suspicions that rod might have killed annabel. when annabel’s friend in new york keeps phoning the house to ask of her whereabouts, rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. the situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat. but this time, rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump. the next day, detective legrand arrives with his partner to question rod about annabel’s whereabouts. despite their stern questioning, rod is not fazed by their questions. after looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls. rod is handcuffed and the fake wall of that he put up is torn down and his crime scene is finally revealed. it reveals that the ever troublesome feline had given birth in annabel’s tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. not to be outdone, rod grabs the pickaxe from legrand\\'s partner and in seconds kills both policemen. but handcuffed and in a panic, rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after nearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. but his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck and killing him. the black cat makes a final appearance and stares at the fate rod had coming for him.',\n",
       " \"at the outset of the film, camille, a young girl from the nguyen dynasty , is adopted by éliane devries after her parents die in a plane crash at the end of the 1910s. madame devries owns and operates a large rubber plantation in indochina that employs many indentured laborers. unmarried, she raises camille as her own daughter. madame devries meets and has a fleeting affair with a younger man, jean-baptiste le guen, a lieutenant in the french navy. when camille is sixteen, a french police officer shoots a vietnamese prisoner who is escaping through the city streets. camille and her classmates had been walking nearby, and just as the prisoner is about to be shot he runs past camille. the prisoner then falls dead onto camille, knocking her unconscious and covering her with his blood. jean-baptiste finds camille, brings her to safety, and cleans off the blood&mdash;cutting off her dress in the process and exposing her bosom. camille awakens in jean-baptiste's arms and immediately falls in love with him. apparently through her connections with high-ranking officials in the navy, madame devries has jean-baptiste transferred to haiphong to protect camille from being hurt. jean-baptiste confronts madame devries about this at a christmas party celebration at her place, and a loud spat ensues. as a result of his misbehavior, instead of being transferred to haiphong, jean-baptiste is sent to a remote french military base in the north of vietnam, on the notorious dragon island. against her better judgment, madame devries allows camille to become engaged to tanh, a young man who has studied in france and supports the communists  in 1930. the marriage is arranged by tanh's wealthy, merchant mother. the day after the engagement, tanh allows camille to leave and look for jean-baptiste up north. camille travels with a vietnamese family, and reaches dragon island. on the island is a market where plantation owners from the south procure indentured servants. the family with whom camille was traveling wishes to find work in this manner, but they are killed by a french naval officer. when jean-baptiste arrives on the scene and demands that the officer tell him what happened, the officer says that the family refused to be split up, and started inciting a riot by yelling communist slogans. jean-baptiste sees camille among the laborers and starts to lead her away. however, upon seeing her traveling companions dead, camille attacks the french officer and then shoots him with his own gun. camille and jean-baptiste escape from the island and sail away through the gulf of tonkin for many days without food or water. eventually, they come ashore and are rescued by a communist theater troupe. the troupe takes them to a hidden valley where they are hidden in a large complex of buildings. eventually, they must leave the valley because the communists have other, more important people to hide. tanh, now a high-ranking communist operative, arranges for the theater troupe to smuggle the lovers into china. guy, the leader of the french police in the south&mdash;a friend and former suitor of madame devries&mdash;attempts to use operatives to put down the insurrection. guy arranges for french agents to look for camille and jean-baptiste in the north. they look up and down the gulf of tonkin but with no success. eventually, guy realizes that traveling theater troupes may be behind many near-simultaneous insurrections in the north. he orders all theater troupes traveling in certain northern routes to be arrested. one morning, when they are just a few hours from the chinese border, jean-baptiste takes his and camille's newborn son étienne to baptize him in a river while camille is sleeping. jean-baptiste and etienne are captured by the french; camille is forced to abandon étienne and jean-baptiste, and escape with the theater troupe. french authorities give étienne to madame devries. jean-baptiste spends time in prison and does not speak with anyone. eventually, however, he agrees to talk if he can first see his son. the navy, which plans to try jean-baptiste in france to avoid a trial in indochina  allows jean-baptiste 24 hours to see étienne and settle his affairs before leaving for france. jean-baptiste goes to see madame devries. she allows him to care for étienne for one night at her other house, in saigon. the next day, when madame devries arrives at the house to pick up étienne, she discovers jean-baptiste lying in bed, shot dead in the temple, gun in hand. étienne is safe in the bed next to him. madame devries is outraged. she tells guy that she suspects the police. however, guy's girlfriend tells madame devries that the communists probably killed jean-baptiste, to keep him quiet. the killing is eventually ruled a suicide. camille is captured and sent to prison. neither guy nor madame devries can see camille. madame devries lobbies government officials for camille's freedom, to no avail. after five years, the popular front comes to power and releases all political prisoners, including camille. madame devries goes to the prison to take camille home. however, rather than return home to her mother and son, camille resolves to join the communists to fight for her country's independence. she does not wish for her son to know the horror she has witnessed. madame devries sells her plantation to tanh's mother. madame devries and étienne return to france. years later, madame devries tells étienne the story of his mother. madame devries takes étienne to geneva, where his mother camille apparently is a communist  delegate to the geneva conference. étienne goes to the hotel where camille is staying, but he cannot bring himself to go to see her. he waits for her in the lobby, but she does not come. he recounts this to madame devries and tells her that she is his mother. the next day, french indochina becomes independent from france. vietnam is partitioned into north and south vietnam.\",\n",

       " 'the film depicts a future in which human beings, known as \"oms\" , are creatures on the draags\\' home planet, where they are seen as pests and sometimes kept as pets . the draags are an alien species which is humanoid in shape but a hundred times larger than humans, with blue skin, fan-like earlobes and huge, protruding red eyes. the draags also live much longer than human beings – one draag week equals a human year. some oms are domesticated as pets, but others run wild, and are periodically exterminated. the draags\\' treatment of the oms is ironically contrasted with their high level of technological and spiritual development. the story opens with a woman running, occasionally looking behind her as if pursued. an enormous hand descends and blocks her way. she runs back the way she came and finds her way blocked by another hand. it becomes apparent that she is being toyed with by entities that do not appreciate her fragility, and as she dies, the infant she has been carrying and attempting to protect begins to cry. the view changes to reveal the draag children who have accidentally killed the woman; they leave quickly when an adult draag and child approach. the child voices concern for the orphaned infant, and the two take the child to their home. tiva  names the infant terr . her father, whom the adult terr voice-over explains is master sinh, the draag great aedile, attaches a collar capable of physically dragging terr back from mischief, and over the next several scenes, their relationships develop. terr witnesses the parents seemingly ingesting food by inhaling it from a device. after changing terr\\'s costume as one would a doll\\'s, tiva uses makeup to give herself a more om-like appearance. when terr impishly trades dark pigment for light, tiva blows some of the powder on him. tiva uses a tiny indoor weather-maker to cause a small storm cloud to form over terr and chase him around the dwelling. tiva takes terr for a walk, and then teaches him how, under certain circumstances, crystals will form on stationary objects, including standing bipeds. she also teaches him that whistling will shatter the crystals. terr happens upon master sinh as he and several compatriots are melding in a ritual, and it is revealed that many draag children have oms like terr when they convene to watch their respective oms interact. tiva\\'s education is supplied by the use of a headset that transmits knowledge directly into the brain of the user. because she enjoys having terr in her hand when she is having her \"infos,\" terr begins to acquire their knowledge. meanwhile, at the seat of government, draag councilors discuss whether the regular extermination of the wild oms is sufficient to keep their numbers at an acceptable level. it is revealed that oms were first found on a planet that retained some evidence of structured life, but the images seem to reveal that earth was in a post-apocalyptic state at the time. terr decides to escape, and to take the headset with him. he does not get very far before tiva realizes he is missing, and her mother tells her to use her bracelet to bring him back. terr finds himself suddenly being dragged backward by the collar. only the headset becoming entangled in plants allows a wild female om to come to his rescue before he is choked by the collar or dragged all the way back. when terr explains that the headset contains the knowledge of the draags but he doesn\\'t know where to go with it, his unnamed rescuer takes him to her tribe, who live in a tree in a walled park. when it is demonstrated that terr can read draag script, the leader  is willing to accept terr into the tribe, but the wizard is not, and demands a trial by combat – to the death. terr and the wizard\\'s champion have child-sized animals bound to their torsos in such a way as to prevent the combatants from using anything but the beaks of said animals to attack. terr is injured, but wins the trial. over the next several scenes, it is shown how the oms have adapted to life on the draags\\' planet. snail-like animals weave clothes onto the oms, predators that would eat oms are in turn hunted and efficiently stripped of useful materials, and the gene pool is kept well-mixed. oms even make the occasional foray into draag areas in search of resources. returning from one such expedition, the group of adventurers is accosted by bandits who drop clawlike harpoons into the cargo and simply lift it up into their own tree. mighty one tells terr that they live on the other side of the park, and cautions him that they are evil. when the now-literate oms read the new sign on one of the walls, they realize the park is about to be \"de-omised.\" terr decides that he must take this information to the tribe of bandits, and is quickly captured and taken before their leader, a wizened old woman. the woman is skeptical of his claims and orders terr\\'s imprisonment. when the de-omising begins, however, the old woman returns and frees him. the de-omising is accomplished using disks that release a poison gas. a great many oms perish from this gas, but a sizable number still manage to escape through a crack in the park wall. two passing draags witness the exodus, and one begins crushing the oms underfoot. the oms retaliate and manage to kill their attacker while the other escapes. afterward, mighty one is revealed to be killed and the old woman leads the survivors to a place where she believes they will be safe. the death of a draag puts the council in an uproar. de-omising is stepped up to a much higher priority, new technologies are developed, and extermination frequency is scheduled to greatly increase. the old woman has led the two now-united tribes to an old rocket depot. applying their newfound knowledge, the oms, under terr\\'s direction, very quickly adapt the abandoned technologies to their own purposes and begin to flourish, thanks to the rebirth of mechanized industry. on a visit to the old woman, terr\\'s wife hears her express both optimism and regret that she will not live to see the oms finally find peace. fatalities resulting from draag attempts to de-om the rocket depot are minimized by the creation and organized use of shelters, but the draags\\' updated de-omising technologies become ever more aggressive, and when an automated scout detects the persistent om settlement, it summons an array of lethal devices. as the attacks become more diverse and effective, the oms launch their manned rockets toward the fantastic planet, where they discover headless humanoid statues. as draag meditation bubbles descend to alight atop the statues, the statues begin to dance. it is revealed via terr\\'s voiceover that this is the secret of the fantastic planet. draag meditation animates the statues and allows the draag to reproduce. when the feet of the dancing statues threaten the rockets, the oms use energy weapons to shatter the statues, effectively killing thousands of meditative draag. pandemonium reigns in the council chamber, for it seems the two species will destroy one another if they cannot find a way to live together. apparently they do just that, for in the very next scene, an om steps down off an outstretched draag hand, removes his silly hat and assumes a posture of confidence and self-assertion. the headset

[spoiler] it turns out that the gynecologist, myung jin  is the mysterious man stalking her as well as the killer. min soo-ah, while in the car with him, remembered that he had a strong scent/cologne, he had a watch on his right hand, and he gave her an iced coffee drink in a glass can. while in the car with him, they hit a bump while in an argument. the body of the dead university student rolls out of the trunk and myung jin gets out to examine it. when min soo-ah goes out as well to inspect the damage done, he claims that he hit a dog, but she reasons with him, starting another fight. he leaves her in the rain when another car comes. the reason why she was in the car with him is because she needed a ride back from visiting the orphanage she used to grow up in. she had gotten angry and stormed out because her ex-guardian tried to give her two things-- tickets to her dead brother\\'s dance group\\'s upcoming dance showdown, and a device that vibrates when a person or moving object-- or any object-- came too close. it would help her with her disability, but min soo-ah strongly disapproved of it. one night when ki-sub is walking home alone, he is followed by myung jin. ki-sub at first runs away, but is snuck up on and hit by a brick. an ambulance comes and the detective/min soo-ah drives to the scene. when the detective finishes up his interviews with the people and follows the ambulance to the hospital, we realize that myung jin was in the background, watching min soo-ah in the car. at the hospital, the doctor tells them that because ki-sub has such a thick skull, only a small fracture was shown in the x-ray scan. they are relieved and visits him. ki-sub gets annoyed by min soo-ah\\'s constant nagging, and on the day of his release, storms out in anger. when he reaches the nearly-empty subway station, he sees min soo-ah on the other side and then sees her ride the subway, as well as the killer. he calls her on her phone and tells her urgently that the killer is in front of her. as he runs to catch up with her, she goes on facetime and shows him her location and surroundings. he guides her out of the subway and to safety, as well as her seeing-dog, seul-gi . however, at one point, she trips, but gets up and feels the ground and way out . however, at one point, the killer catches up with her and leads her away, with a knife to her body. she reaches into her handbag and sprays his eyes with her pepper spray and runs off with seul-gi. when she reaches the elevator, she thought that she\\'d be safe, but the killer quickly gets in. ki-sub, who still sees her surroundings by facetime, gets scared when he sees blood splatter on the elevator\\'s button and the fact that min soo-ah fainted. however, what they didn\\'t know at the time was that seul-gi shielded min soo-ah from the knife and while she was getting stabbed, grabbed the killer by the jacket and led him out of the elevator. in that scene, seul-gi dies by being stabbed many times while watching her owner go up through the elevator. when min soo-ah wakes up, she asks for her seeing dog, but the doctor handed her the blood-stained leash. at home, min soo-ah listens to many video tapes of her past self, when she had just graduated from the police academy. she laid down and listened to her brother\\'s voice, as well as the voice of the orphanage lady. halfway through, she gets a call from an unknown number. there is a raspy voice. the caller warns her from this case. \"you can\\'t see me, but i\\'m watching you.\" a few days later, the detective had narrowed down the number of licensed imported black sedans and finally, in a garage, he finds the killer. they get into a violent fight, in which the detective dies and the killer drives off. meanwhile, ki-sub and min soo-ah visits the orphanage again when they\\'re asked to watch over it while the grandmother takes the children out. ki-sub finds the dead brother\\'s room and various pictures. min soo-ah goes to the \\'office\\' and finds a cabinet filled with her past memories as a cop, as well as the vibrating motion sensor. the killer enters into the living room and lights a cigarette and listens to some music. min soo-ah, annoyed by the music, goes downstairs to turn it off. she reprimands ki-sub for playing it, but smells the cigarette. ki-sub goes upstairs and fights with myung jin while min soo-ah runs away. after a few minutes of them playing cat and mouse, she lights him on fire and takes the vibrating motion sensor. she helps ki-sub outside, where it\\'s raining. ki-sub fights the killer again and min soo-ah goes to the car and breaks it with the motion sensor. the killer runs at her with a knife and with the right timing and the motion sensor, she hits him on the head, making him fall unconsious. the police, who had picked up the detective\\'s body, had found the evidence and eventually found out who the killer was. the killer was put in jail and min soo-ah was re-admitted to the academy and graduated again. ki-sub also enrolled into the police academy. it ends with another video, similar to the video of her first graduation, except instead of her surrogate brother, it had ki-sub. while the credits roll, you see pictures of them respectfully visiting the detective\\'s funeral.',\n",

reveals that this boat  has snagged and torn several nets recently due to something on the sea floor, despite the charts showing nothing in the area. cap and neely decide that despite the financial strain of losing their expensive nets, they can afford one more trip to investigate the source of the snags. neely and barb go to duffy\\'s restaurant where they meet mom, ryan and baby. neely asks to speak privately with ryan and requests that mom sing his favorite song. it is baby\\'s birthday, but she agrees to leave the table while mom steps up to the stage and performs the film\\'s title song, carib gold. during the song, barb and neely talk to ryan about diving to the sea bed to look for the cause of the torn nets. he agrees, and they make arrangements to set out the following morning. barb\\'s wife dottie sees them off at the dock, and he promises her they will be back soon. when they reach the area, the boat\\'s crew assists ryan into his atmospheric diving suit. ryan goes over the side while crewmen operate the manual hand pump, and barb and neely operate the communications unit. on reaching the bottom, ryan heads south and quickly discovers what appears to be the wreckage of a boat. he brings up a coin and discusses his discovery of sunken treasure with neely and barb, mentioning that there is bullion as well. the three speculate that they have discovered a \"spanish plate ship.\" back at duffy\\'s, the three discuss salvaging the ship with cap and mom. ryan points out that a larger and trustworthy crew will be required in order to salvage the wreck. barb goes home and tells dottie about the find, shows her the coin and tells her that they need to \"chip in,\" in order to help finance the salvage of the wreck. dottie begins to cry, disbelieving that the coin is real and thinking that this will deprive her of needed surgery. barb introduces a new diver, lechock, to the rest of the salvage crew, who seem wary of the newcomer but take him on and agree to set out the next morning. once underway, lechock quickly shows himself to be a belligerent shipmate, threatening to toss another member of the crew overboard. at the site, ryan once again suits up and returns to the wreck, while filling a basket the crew later sent down for retrieval of the treasure. lechock appears mesmerized by the bullion when it comes aboard, while ryan remains working underwater. neely calls cap with their status, who promises to bring out supplies so that they can remain at the site and work. as cap\\'s supply boat approaches later, lechock is suiting up for a dive. neely explains to cap that lechock has alienated the entire crew and seems to have \"a chip on his shoulder.\" after sundown, lechock is seen putting a pistol into his waistband and slipping into the cabin where the gold is kept in an apparently unlocked safe. while taking two of the gold bars, he accidentally wakes barb, pistol-whips him to death and then escapes with the bullion by stealing cap\\'s boat. ryan, neely and cap see lechock leave with the boat, then investigate the cabin where they discover the stolen bullion and barb\\'s body. neely calls the key west harbor police

chicken-feather whisk, the dancer selects a woman who joins him in the dance, soon to be followed by the entire group as the dancer brushes the doll with the whisk. as ryan searches for lechock, the fugitive evades the police by slipping through a door. the door happens to lead into the \"key oasis\" bar, where ryan is having a drink. when ryan notices lechock, he immediately attacks while the other patrons watch. the fight results in lechock knocked out on the floor as ryan leaves the bar. he returns to duffy\\'s, where mom urges him to stay and let law enforcement handle the case. ryan

       " 'the film opens in a montreal apartment, where a woman named lisa  waits for an old man to sew bags of heroin into the cloth body of an old-fashioned doll. as she leaves the apartment with the doll, we see the man watching her leave, then dialing someone on the phone. lisa takes the doll with her on an airline flight to new york city, but when, on disembarking, she sees a man watching her, she becomes worried and gives the doll for safekeeping to a man she\\'d spoken with on the plane, professional photographer sam hendrix . the man who\\'d been watching lisa then roughly escorts her away. later, when lisa calls sam to ask for the doll, sam and his wife are unable to find it. some time afterward, small-time con artist mike talman  and his partner carlino  arrive at the basement apartment where sam lives with his wife susy , who is blind. the two men watch until both the apartment\\'s occupants have left, then enter. the con men have an appointment with lisa, who\\'d been their partner in crime prior to the recent imprisonment of both, but they are met instead by harry roat, jr. , whom the audience recognizes as the man who watched and met lisa at the airport. after discovering lisa\\'s body hanging in a garment bag, talman and carlino want to make a quick exit, but roat points out that they have left their fingerprints all over the apartment, while he has worn gloves. roat is then able to prevail upon the two to help him dispose of lisa\\'s body--he\\'d caught her going into business for herself, he explains--and to help him try to find the heroin-stuffed doll. later that day, susy\\'s neighbor leaves for the weekend, and sam leaves for a business trip the next morning. once susy is alone, the criminals begin an elaborate con game: in order to gain entry into the apartment, talman poses as a friend of sam\\'s, carlino poses as a policeman, and roat poses first as an old man and then as the man\\'s son. using first an innocuous story about sam and the doll, then a darker one implying that lisa has been murdered and that sam will be suspected, the men persuade susy to help them find the doll. talman gives her the number for the phone booth across the street as his own after falsely warning her of a police car stationed outside. during this time, susy has grown suspicious of carlino and roat, and gloria , a girl who lives upstairs and is paid by the couple to help susy with errands, has been going in and out of the apartment, sometimes without susy\\'s noticing that she is there. after talman leaves, gloria sneaks into the apartment carrying the doll, which she stole some time earlier. she tells susy there is no police car outside, and susy discovers the doll. wanting to confirm her suspicions about carlino and roat, susy tells gloria to go home and watch the phone booth. if a man goes into it, gloria is to phone susy, let the phone ring twice, and hang up. gloria tells susy she can signal her by banging on the pipes. on carlino\\'s next visit, after he calls roat at the phone booth, gloria sends susy the telephone signal, and she sends the signal a second time after susy calls talman to tell him she has the doll. finally realizing that talman is a criminal, susy hides the doll. when he walks in with corlino and roat following quietly, she tells him the doll is at sam\\'s studio. the criminals leave after roat cuts the telephone cord. when susy bangs on the pipes, gloria comes in and susy sends her to the bus station in a taxi to wait for sam. when susy discovers that the telephone cord has been cut, she prepares to defend herself by putting the criminals in the dark along with her, breaking all the bulbs in the apartment\\'s light fixtures. she also pours a chemical into a bowl. when talman returns, she refuses to cooperate. talman has spent the most time with susy and he has come to admire her for her quiet strength and ability to stand up to the three criminals, despite her disability. he admits to her that he and his confederates are part of a criminal plot and that sam, as susy suspected, is completely innocent of any involvement, while roat is a particular danger. susy needn\\'t worry, though, talman says, as he has sent carlino to kill roat. however, roat has killed carlino instead, and, as talman prepares to leave, pausing to say something to susy as he stands in the doorway, roat stabs him in the back. intent on acquiring the doll, roat chains the door shut in the dark apartment, pours gasoline on the floor, and sets a piece of newspaper on fire. a desperate battle follows in which susy throws the chemical in roat\\'s face and she forces him to put out the fire. but the battle ends when roat obtains light by opening the refrigerator, whose door he props open with a rag in the hinge. susy, weeping, pulls the doll out from its hiding place and hands it to him. while roat cuts open the doll and gloats over the treasure inside, susy is able, unnoticed by him, to arm herself with a large kitchen knife. roat then pushes susy towards the bedroom, making an ambiguous threat as to his intentions. as he pushes her forward, susy suddenly turns and stabs roat in the belly. she flees his grasp, but is unable to escape through the chained door. she stumbles across the floor toward the kitchen window to scream for help, but roat unexpectedly leaps out from the darkened bedroom and grabs her ankle. screaming, susy wrenches free, but the dying roat doggedly pursues her, using the knife with which she stabbed him to drag himself across the floor. susy is at the refrigerator, trying to close its door and thus extinguish its light, unaware of the rag that is preventing its closure. she then gropes for the refrigerator\\'s cord, murmuring desperately, \"where is it?\" as the reeling roat stands with his last strength and staggers toward her with the knife, susy\\'s scream merges with the sound of a police siren, and the scene switches to the arrival of police cars outside the apartment. when the police enter with sam and gloria, sam finds an unbroken light bulb and we see the room littered with the bodies of talman and roat, but no susy. finally, as sam calls out for her, the door of the unplugged refrigerator moves, and susy emerges from behind it, alive.',\n",

younger sister shelby  are preparing a guest list for their parents surprise 30th wedding anniversary, their parents appear at ava's office arguing with one another. betty reveals to ava that bradley had an affair 25 years ago, and declares that she wants a divorce. when ava tries to counsel them, they refuse because she is their daughter and much less maritally experienced. ava decides to try and save her parents' marriage. when her mother refuses to live with her father, she moves her father into her house, without consulting charlie. charlie is upset because ava didn't ask him first. she apologizes to charlie and promises that her father will only stay with them for a short period. their friend, gerber, suddenly shows up at their door with his new polish wife, kasia, whom he had met the night before in a bar. gerber tells ava about charlie’s first marriage ten years ago, which she didn't know about. the revelation upsets ava, and charlie apologies for not telling her about it earlier. he explains that it took place under the influence of alcohol when he was 22 years old, and only lasted for a few weeks. due to ava’s father living with them, and her obsessing over trying to repair her parents' marriage, ava & charlie’s own marriage deteriorates because they are not having sex. ava sends her parents to a different counselor, who suggests that they follow the “death break” therapy - no contact with one another so that they feel the absence, and therefore value each other, which is supposed to bring them closer together. ava knows that this therapy only works over long periods of time, which, due to the party, she doesn’t have. she decides to take them to another counselor, along with charlie. during one of the exercises, one spouse climbs a rock tower while the other spouse holds the rope which helps build trust between the partners. during the exercise, ava's parents get into an argument and her father leaves the rope, leaving betty suspended in air calling for help. ava leaves her own rope, which is supporting charlie, and tries to help her mother, which results in charlie falling, injuring his back and neck. ava apologizes, but he warns her that her distracted behavior is causing a increasing gulf between them. in secret, ava continues planning the 30th anniversary surprise party. however, her mother throws a wrench in her plans and tells ava that she is leaving on a trip to south asia in 10 days for six months. ava feels that her plan to bring her parents back together is failing, so she decides to play a trick on them in a last-ditch effort. she enlists charlie to take her father out for a men's night and bring him back to the house later. charlie takes her father to a bar where gerber meets them. much to charlie's chagrin, gerber takes them to a stripper club. at the club, the men drink excessively and bradley enjoys the strip club’s dancers. gerber tells bradley that, because he is rich, he can marry a young, hot girl from europe. charlie and bradley are drunk when they reach home where ava is waiting with her mother. under the influence of gerber's advice, a drunken bradley tells betty that she can leave because he wants to marry one of the young european girls, which effectively destroys ava's plan. ava gets angry with charlie for his childish behavior, which spoiled her last chance to bring her parents together. in response, charlie complains that their lack of a sex life is caused by ava's excessive determination to avoid her parents' inevitable divorce. shelby decides to take betty to a speed dating party so that she can meet other men. during the party, betty meets many men, but realizes that none can replace her husband. meanwhile, at ava's, bradley asks ava to give him some pills to help him sleep. ava concedes, and tells her father to take two pills, but he takes three and falls dead asleep. then, ava deviously flushes away the rest of pills in the toilet and calls an ambulance, claiming that her father took all of the sleeping pills of the bottle in a suicide attempt. the paramedics take bradley to the hospital where he is admitted. then, ava calls her mother and informs her that bradley tried to commit suicide after losing her. betty rushes to the hospital where ava and charlie are already waiting. bradley's doctor tells them that he hadn't, in fact, taken many of the pills and that he'll be fine. betty goes in to bradley’s room where they reunite, and betty tells bradley that she realized that in spite of their disagreements, he is the best man she'd ever known. charlie asks ava about the number of pills bradley had taken, and she admits that she had created the whole incident in an attempt to bring her parents together. charlie is upset by this and yells at ava for her manipulative behavior, and for not telling him about her plan, after which he storms out of the hospital. when ava and shelby are about to leave the hospital, they discover that bradley had produced a son from the affair that bradley didn't know about. however, betty has forgiven bradley and welcomes his son into the family. later that night, when ava reaches home, she discovers that charlie had left, leaving a note saying that he is “staying at gerber's… need some time.” the next day, ava goes in to charlie’s office to apologize for her actions, and asks him to come back home. he replies that “he can't answer that right now”. she invites him to her parents' 30th anniversary party, which is now back on, but he declines, saying that he isn't in the mood for celebrating. upon hearing this, ava becomes enraged and accuses charlie of having an affair with his secretary, adriana. he denies that there is an affair, questions her motives for marrying him, suggesting that perhaps she had only done so to boost her career and lend credibility to her marriage counseling business. ava is stunned, and leaves when charlie takes a business call. the next day, gerber kicks charlie out because kasia’s parents, two brothers, and three cousins are on their way for a visit. charlie is surprised to hear gerber talk to his wife in polish, and questions him. gerber says that if you love someone and want to live a successful married life, you have to accept and respect their family as well. at her parents' house, ava asks her father for a drink so that she can keep herself in control during the anniversary party, still reeling from the breakdown of her own marriage. then, she takes her parents to the party, where they are surprised and pleased. ava, who is sitting alone thinking about her ruined married, is approached by shelby, who is worried about her and asks where charlie is, to which ava replies, “i don’t think he is going to make it.” shelby gets upset, and tells ava that she only has herself to blame for her failing marriage, as she neglected charlie in her quest to save her parents' marriage, first denying her husband sex and then baselessly accusing him of adultery. ava apologizes and admits that she isn't perfect and may not know everything about marriage. shelby responds that she should say that to charlie, at which ava rushes out of the party to find charlie, but meets him as he's on the way in to find her. she apologizes for her behavior and they renew their wedding vows. when charlie asks ava if she wants to go back in to the party, she suggests they consummate their marriage instead. at the end of the film, footage is shown of charlie with his and ava's baby daughter laughing.\",\n",

that all employees of the nezzer chocolate factory may celebrate by eating as many bunnies as they like for thirty minutes.http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/pre2000/rvu-veg4.html while

it were a big bunny, all of his employees would love it as much as he. mr. nezzer then shows them a model despicting a ninety-foot bunny statue for his employees to worship. he also demonstrates a song of worship called \"the bunny song\" with lyrics stating that nothing in the world, be it god, parents, healthy food, church, or school, is more important than \"the bunny\". when asked by rack as to what would happen if someone refuses to sing and worship, mr. nezzer draws their attention to the furnace  and warns that \"in my mind, if you don\\'t bow down and sing the song... you\\'re a

       " 'it is 1938 and the nazis are just one step away from invading and occupying czechoslovakia. hana is a young czech film actress who also happens to be jewish. she has just appeared in her first feature with her leading man, an older jewish actor, who warns her that her career is over and that their picture will never see the light of day since the nazis will never allow its release. he hands her a forged passport and papers to get out of the country but she throws them in the trash, not believing what he says about the imminent german invasion one bit. as the filming of the \\'film within a film\\' is on the verge of completion, we see the two actors riding stationery bicycles with a moving image in the background. as was the usual practice in creating films in earlier days, the illusion of motion is created when the moving image flickers in the background but the object in the foreground is static. thus, the bicyclist becomes a symbol for the man who pedals furiously but is actually going nowhere. that man is the czech everyman of 1938 who desperately wishes to escape his tragic circumstances but in reality remains motionless, trapped by the forces of tyranny. throughout the film, we catch glimpses of the film\\'s protagonist, emil, pedaling furiously, superimposed over the screen\\'s larger canvas. hana is married to emil, a journalist, who is conscripted by collaborating czech officials, to serve as a radio announcer for the occupying german forces. a colleague at the radio station, franta, will not keep quiet and he is taken away presumably by the gestapo and later executed. emil, no hard core collaborator, chooses to accept the job working as the mouthpiece for the nazis in order to save his wife from being deported to the death camps. emil\\'s boss at the radio station is a nazi sympathizer who offers him the job with the agreement that no one will bother him about his wife as long as she remains holed up in their apartment. soon, emil has become popular hosting a cultural program in prague entitled, \"voices of our home\". meanwhile hana becomes bored sitting at home and jeopardizes emil\\'s position by leaving their apartment, usually attending the cinema. hana is not depicted as one who is to be pitied—rather, she is a narcissist who refuses to accept her position as a jew in nazi-occupied czechoslovakia as well as living under the illusion that she is someone important—the up-and-coming film star that she used to be. emil begins having an affair with a former colleague at the station who is now engaged to his boss. meanwhile hana starts hanging out with a former medical student and now a morphine-addicted projectionist. he wants to go to bed with her but she resists his advances, eventually allowing him, however, to take pictures of her in the nude. at this point in the film, things slow down considerably since hana is no longer talking to emil with the conflict between the two principals, grinding to a halt. the plot picks up when hana\\'s former co-star shows up at their apartment having just escaped from a death transport . emil is horrified that hana allows him to take a bath in the apartment and throws him out on the street. enraged at emil for throwing her ex-colleague out, hana dons her blond wig and adopts the persona of her character from her movie and crashes emil\\'s boss\\'s wedding. emil is on the verge of being fired for his \\'transgression\\' when reich protector heydrich is assassinated by czech partisans. nazi soldiers do a house-to-house search and discover hana is in the apartment. when they realize who emil is, they take no action against hana, despite the fact that the soldiers know she is jewish. later the nazis broadcast a description of a bicycle used by one of the partisans who has killed heydrich. emil has another affair with a ditsy gossip columnist and takes her family\\'s bicycle back to his apartment and attempts to hide it; this leads hana to believe that emil has switched sides and is now helping the partisans. now emil\\'s boss orders him to prove his loyalty by reading a loyalty oath over the airwaves after the heydrich assassination places all czech citizens in jeopardy. meanwhile, hana has come down to earth after she escapes arrest during the house-to-house search. she packs her belongings and turns herself into the authorities. emil decides not to show up at the broadcast to read the loyalty oath and goes looking for hana. in the final scene, emil finds her in a crowd of jews being marched to the death transports; as he stands impassively, preventing the group from marching forward, nazi soldiers club him in the head, pushing him off to the side of the road.',\n",

i did taw a puddy tat!” sylvester jumps for joy and runs to the building tweety is in , but fails to notice the sign banning cats and dogs from the building. this results in a confrontation with the guard just inside the door, who kicks sylvester out. next, sylvester climbs up the drainpipe of the broken arms apartment building while tweety sings the song \"when irish eyes are smiling\". behind tweety and off-camera, sylvester swings a paw in metronome rhythm to his “snack\\'s” song. only then does tweety realize that sylvester is watching him. he calls for help and jumps out of his cage; sylvester chases him through the room. however, tweety\\'s owner, granny is ready for him. she throws him out the window and, looking down on him, snarls: “yeah that\\'ll teach ya! next time i\\'ll give you what for!” tweety joins in the scolding: “bad ol\\' puddy tat!” sylvester paces around the door, then gets an idea: to climb up in the drainpipe. instead of getting scared again, tweety now drops a bowling ball into the drainpipe. the heavy ball collides with sylvester – and he swallows it!

france on a ship with casquette girls who are traveling to new orleans to marry colonists . on board ship, marietta becomes friends with julie, a young and pretty casquet girl whom the princess also befriends. enroute to new orleans, the casquette girls discuss what type of man they want to marry, and \"marietta\" shocks the other girls by stating that she does not intend to get married to anyone. shortly after this discussion, the ship is boarded by pirates who kill the entire crew and take the girls ashore – along with the goods the ship was carrying. when the pirates finish sharing out the bounty among themselves, they turn their attention to the girls. just then, singing is heard . the pirates comment that it is the mercenaries and they rush around to extinguish \\'torches\\' and the fire so that they won\\'t be noticed. however \"marietta\" takes one of the lit \\'torches\\' and runs towards the sound of the singing, crying out \"help, help\" – and this leads to a fight between the mercenaries and the pirates, which the mercenaries win. the surviving pirates escape in canoes. there are further songs from the mercenaries, including their leader, captain richard warrington, singing \"neath a southern moon\" to marietta. although marietta and captain warrington are attracted to each other, problems arise, including captain warrington declaring that he does not intend to get married. when captain warrington and his men take the casquette girls to new orleans by boats, they are welcomed by the governor of new orleans , and the casquette girls are then taken to the convent where they are to stay until they meet the men who will become their husbands. when some men approach marietta, she comments that she does not want to marry any of them. the governor and his wife, accompanied by captain warrington, now arrive and the governor comments that he feels sure he has seen marietta before in paris, but marietta convinces him that he is wrong about this. marietta pretends to be a courtesan and is sent away in disgrace to live in a house by herself. captain warrington takes over the duties of the french soldiers who are escorting her to her new home. at the house, an uncomfortable marietta tries in vain to get rid of captain warrington, who is persisting in staying there – when marietta states that she will call the police to throw warrington out, the captain tells her that he is the police. just then, there is the welcome interruption of the sound of singing from a group of strolling gypsies who are advertising their marionette theater. the daughter of the gypsy leader  then sings, and warrington joins in the singing . stung by a comment from warrington that she  would not be able to sing as well as rodolpho\\'s daughter, marietta also joins in the singing. a short time later, there is a knock at the door, and three frenchmen are standing outside, asking to see marietta. while warrington is getting rid of the three would-be \\'lovers\\' of the beautiful \"courtesan\", marietta escapes from the house and can\\'t be found. the following day, captain warrington discovers that marietta is working at the marionette theater, where she is a success. while performing, marietta becomes aware that captain warrington is in the audience and, when he visits her dressing room, following the performance, marietta tells him that his presence there is \\'most unwelcome\\' – when the captain asks her if he would be welcome \\'somewhere else\\', marietta says \"yes\". when marietta leaves the marionette theater to have some lunch, captain warrington joins her, commenting \"here i am – welcome me\". marietta is very amused at this and is unable to suppress a smile. they become friends when captain warrington comments that marietta can trust him, because he will \\'keep her out in the open from now on\\'. while marietta and warrington are eating lunch together, there is an announcement of an award for information leading to marietta\\'s whereabouts. marietta is once again rescued from her situation by captain warrington, who takes marietta away by boat. captain warrington wonders who marietta really is – saying that at least he knows that marietta is not what she said she was. marietta comments that she is just \\'someone from somewhere\\'. it is during this time that marietta and captain warrington discover that they are falling in love with each other . when captain warrington asks marietta to sing the song back to him, she says that she has a song she knows better. leaving the boat to walk to warrington\\'s headquarters, they are accosted by french soldiers and marietta\\'s true identity of princess marie is revealed. captain warrington is stunned about this and attempts to stop the french soldiers taking marietta away. at the governor\\'s palace, the governor shows marietta \\'the king\\'s mandate\\' and comments that don carlos must be a most loving suitor to have followed her to new orleans. he also comments that a ball will be given in marietta\\'s \\'honor\\'. the governor\\'s wife then enters the room and comments that she is horrified at marietta\\'s adventures and asks marietta to confide in her and let her be \\'mother\\' because she was an older woman. it is night and marietta is dressed for the ball. julie, who has heard that marietta is really a princess, comes to marietta\\'s room, asking to see marietta because \\'she knows me\\'. marietta welcomes her and julie is able to tell marietta that captain warrington had been ordered to leave new orleans that day, but had not gone – and that he was intending to come to the ball. marietta is delighted at this. however, her uncle comes to her room and mentions that \\'if warrington attempted to see her again, he would be arrested for treason and shot\\'. frightened for the man she loves, marietta asks julie to go to captain warrington and stop him from coming to the ball – however, they realise is too late when they hear warrington and his men singing . inside the ballroom, marietta\\'s uncle is dancing with the governor\\'s wife – while the governor is dancing with marietta. when captain warrington walks into the room, the governor stops dancing with marietta and tries to get warrington to leave in order to save warrington\\'s life. after the captain dances with marietta, she tells him that she will sing \\'her\\' song to him the following evening. when warrington is leaving the house, marietta sings her song – and warrington joins in singing a duet with her . following this, marietta\\'s uncle knocks on her door, demanding she leave with them on the ship back to france. however, the captain and marietta escape by the balcony stairway, where they are captured by two guards, who are actually the captain\\'s mercenaries in disguise. meanwhile, her uncle and his guards are able to break in through the locked door and appear at the balcony demanding the arrest of the

on the grounds that if either of them called, the police could trace their voices and connect them to the job, as the blind man would be able to say he saw  gus at the store. the plan goes into action, and gus goes to smalls\\' house where he is surprised by the reverend, wielding a gun. from outside the house, two shots are heard. at the same time, charlie explains the alibi at the bar,

them with a small bit of whiskey, laced with highly concentrated thallium. she disregards it as nonsense, but charlie and gus make her empty her pockets, where they find the tell-tale flask of poison whiskey. they make her drink some, and she pretends to die, but begins laughing at their foolishness, as it isn\\'t poisoned at all. they check for the agent, but he has disappeared, so they go out

       " 'a us government satellite crash lands near piedmont, utah, and two teenagers find it and bring it back to town. the town\\'s inhabitants open it and release a deadly microorganism, which is later codenamed andromeda by the us army. a team is sent from the army\\'s bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. the video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of general george mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \"wildfire,\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the united states. the team, headed by its creator, dr. jeremy stone, investigates piedmont. they retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year old man and a colicky baby who have survived the andromeda outbreak. in an isolated underground laboratory, the wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors. the laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor. in the event of a contamination breach, a 15-minute self-destruct sequence would be automatically initiated; however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary, major bill keane, designated by the odd-man hypothesis, is the only person able to deactivate the sequence, using his pass key and right thumbprint. the scientists begin their analysis of the andromeda strain by recovering a sample from inside the satellite. they initially discover that the microorganism is contained within a delivery system of buckyballs, a technology more advanced than anything known at present. the team theorizes that andromeda may have an extraterrestrial origin, as it has no dna or amino acids. the team discovers andromeda is an airborne microorganism that kills its host by entering the bloodstream through the lungs and coagulating the blood in the body, causing death within 10 seconds via a blood clot in the brain. those who manage to survive the blood clot become insane, extremely violent and suicidal. it is revealed that the two survivors from piedmont had not been affected by andromeda because of their acidotic blood. however, all initial tests with antibiotics and chemical agents regularly used to kill other microorganisms show no effect on andromeda. cable news reporter jack nash becomes aware of some of the events related to the fallen satellite and andromeda. as he investigates further, chuck beeter, the director of the nsa, uses general mancheck\\'s aide, colonel ferrus, to perform assassinations to prevent knowledge of andromeda from reaching the civilian population. nash travels to one of the temporary army outposts performing quarantine procedures, and witnesses the effects of andromeda spreading through various modes of transportation. he becomes a target of assassination due to his presence at the outpost, but manages to escape ferrus and his subordinates. in an attempt to neutralize the problem, the president of the united states authorizes a small tactical nuclear strike on the quarantine area in hopes of completely irradiating and destroying andromeda. when the wildfire team is informed, they realize that they have not reviewed the test results for irradiating andromeda. they find that the microorganism grows at an exponential rate when irradiated. the wildfire team alerts the president, and the air-strike is called off before the pilot launches the nuclear missile. however, as the jet continues to fly over the quarantine area, the pilot reports a malfunction of the aircraft\\'s controls. through video feed, the wildfire team and president watch in shock and horror as all plastic components of the aircraft, including the pilot\\'s visor, disintegrate. the nuclear missile is re-armed, the jet and missile crash into the ground, and the missile detonates, irradiating the quarantine area. the team examine the footage of the crash, and realize that andromeda did not attack the pilot until after the missile launch sequence was halted, leading the team to believe that andromeda has the ability to think. they also realize that andromeda has mutated into several variations, with different means of spreading and different effects. as andromeda grows and mutates into more virulent forms, the wildfire team continue their tests to find a way to stop andromeda before it reaches las vegas, the closest city to the quarantine zone with an international airport. further studies reveals andromeda is actually a sulfur-based compound. a set of tests with phages reveals that one phage has the ability to kill andromeda. however, repeated tests with this phage prove unsuccessful, causing the wildfire team to theorize that andromeda can communicate through an unknown mechanism between its separate parts. a binary code encoded on buckyball casings with potassium and rubidium atoms is also discovered. the information included the 6-digit number “739528” and the word “bacillus infernus” encoded in ascii, and a bitmap image of a symbol with interlocking triangles. bacillus infernus is the name of an archaebacterium found only at the thermal vents on the ocean floors. at this time president scott was championing the new and controversial industry of thermal vent mining, and it was likely that the mining would eradicate the bacteria. the encoded information causes stone to realize andromeda must have a connection with earth, and leads stone to force general mancheck to reveal the truth about the satellite. mancheck reveals “project scoop,” a confidential mission to examine a wormhole that had appeared near earth. it consisted of a satellite sent to collect organic samples, but it malfunctioned during the mission and crashed. with this information, the wildfire team infer that andromeda could have been sent from earth\\'s future, possibly because society in the future could not destroy the contagion due to a lack of a natural resource - bacillus infernus. tests with bacillus infernus reveal that the bacterium easily consumes and destroys andromeda because of andromeda\\'s sulfur structure. the wildfire team begins to grow large amounts of the bacterium in culture vats, intending to release the cultures over the quarantined area once a sufficient quantity is grown. the team also begins to destroy the remaining samples of andromeda in the lab in an attempt to prevent andromeda from communicating the nature of the tests with its other parts. eventually, enough bacteria are grown and they are sprayed over the quarantined area, eradicating all traces of andromeda from the environment. as part of a government conspiracy to preserve andromeda for future use, colonel ferrus blackmails dr. barton to keep a sample. the sample mutates and disintegrates the sample casing, setting off the lab\\'s contamination breach sensor and initiating the self-destruct sequence. the self-destruct sequence also causes the flashing emergency lights to turn on, triggering chou\\'s photosensitive epilepsy, which causes him to inadvertently destroy the self-destruct control panel on the lab level of the complex. with the elevators deactivated due to the self-destruct sequence, keane decides to climb to the control panel on the level above through the lab\\'s main exhaust vent. however, the pipes and other components in the vent have begun to deteriorate due to the mutation in the andromeda sample. the pipe keane climbs suddenly bends, dangling keane above the radioactive water at the base of the vent. before falling, keane manages to throw his badge to stone. realizing keane\\'s right thumb is also required to shutdown the self-destruct sequence, chou sacrifices his life to enter the radioactive water to cut off keane\\'s thumb for stone. with keane\\'s thumb and badge, stone reaches the control panel and deactivates the sequences; albeit with only seconds to spare. as the remaining wildfire team attends the funerals of their fallen colleagues, both general mancheck and colonel ferrus are secretly assassinated. dr. stone reveals some of the events to the public in an interview with jack nash. in the final scene, the saved sample of the andromeda is inserted into a containment compartment with the access code “739528”, held in a vessel marked with a symbol with interlocking triangles. director beeter watches over the operation on the computer in his office. the camera then zooms out, revealing andromeda has been stored within a space station orbiting earth.the ending implies that the sample saved on the space station is the cause of the outbreak in the future that necessitated sending the virus back to the present via the wormhole, creating an ontological paradox as to the virus\\' origin.',\n",

       " 'the action takes place in ancient rome, judaea, capri, and galilee in a time period stretching from 32 a.d. to 38 a.d.the beginning date is given as the \"18th year of tiberius, and the ending date is a year after the historical year of the accession of caligula as roman emperor. diana tells caligula that she had not heard from marcellus for almost a year when marcellus was in cana of galilee. at that time marcellus was told by paulus that caligula was then the emperor. marcellus gallio , son of an important roman senator  and himself a military tribune begins the film in a prologue that introduces the viewer to the might and scope of the roman empire. he is notorious as a ladies’ man, but he is captivated by the reappearance of a childhood sweetheart diana , ward of the emperor tiberius  and empress julia , in caligula\\'s pavilion. as caligula is the grandnephew and heir to tiberius, diana is unofficially promised in marriage to him as empress julia thinks diana would be good for him. when caligula comes to the marketplace with military fanfare to take part in the slave auction, marcellus makes the mistake of bidding against him for a defiant greek slave demetrius  - and winning. caligula feels he had been made a fool of in front of diana, while marcellus feels that he had wronged demetrius by stopping him earlier when he had escaped from his slaveholders. angrily caligula leaves with diana and the rest of his military escort and issues orders for marcellus to receive a military transfer to jerusalem in palestine. marcellus has demetrius released, and he orders him to go on his own to the gallio home. at the gallio home, cornelia and lucia, marcellus\\'s mother and sister, are informed by diana about the situation at the marketplace. lucia remarks that marcellus is still in love with diana. marcellus is surprised to find demetrius waiting for him when he gets home. unofficially marcellus had freed demetrius, but demetrius feels honor bound to compensate marcellus by being his servant. demetrius accompanies marcellus to palestine, but before the galley sails, diana comes to see marcellus, pledging her love for him and her intention to intercede on his behalf with tiberius. marcellus declares his love for diana and asks her to make the emperor promise not to give her in marriage to caligula. marcellus rides into jerusalem with the centurion paulus  on the same day as jesus\\' triumphal entry on palm sunday. jesus confronts demetrius as he rides into jerusalem, silently calling him with his eyes to be his follower. when demetrius later finds out what the romans have in store for jesus, he tries to warn him about the intentions of the romans to arrest him. however, jesus has already been arrested, as demetrius finds out from a chance meeting with judas. jesus is arrested and condemned by pontius pilate , the procurator, who sends for marcellus to take charge of the detail of roman soldiers assigned to crucify him. as pilate finishes washing his hands, he tells marcellus that he is being recalled to italy by the emperor and tells marcellus of the duty he must perform before he leaves. as marcellus leaves, pilate pines about the past night and asks for water so that he can wash his hands again. marcellus and the other soldiers cast lots for jesus\\' robe, and marcellus wins. on the way back into jerusalem, marcellus compels demetrius to throw the robe over him as the two of them are caught in the rain. it is then that marcellus begins to feel remorse for the crucifixion of jesus. when the robe is on him he has a painful seizure, and he orders demetrius to take it off him. when demetrius does so he has had enough: he curses marcellus and the roman empire and runs away. marcellus now behaves like a madman haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion. what sets him off is any reference to being \"out there\" on calvary. he cries out fitfully, \"were you out there?!\" he does this in the presence of tiberius himself when he reports to him on capri. tiberius is portrayed as a benevolent elder statesman, who wants to help marcellus, so, at the prompting of his soothsayer dodinius  and marcellus\\'s own enthusiasm, he gives him an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe while gathering a list of names of jesus\\' followers. at diana\\'s request, tiberius leaves her free to marry marcellus even though tiberius believes him to be mad. after leaving capri, marcellus is next seen sometime later with a syrian guide abidor  outside the village of cana. he is posing as a cloth merchant going about buying up homespun cloth. to further his investigation marcellus pays exorbitant prices for any kind of cloth, even rags. justus, a weaver in cana , reprimands his fellow christians for accepting such unfair prices as being contrary to the teachings of jesus and his fellow christians give back the excess amounts voluntarily. seeing justus as a lead in his investigations marcellus seeks to ingratiate himself with justus by giving his young grandson jonathan , whose club foot had been healed by jesus, one of his pack donkeys. marcellus also wanders in on a public performance by the paralytic miriam as she sings a song of jesus\\' resurrection. when marcellus returns to his camp he is confronted by a greedy abidor, who wants to turn in justus and the others to pilate, who has ordered the arrest of jesus\\' followers. abidor, who is obsessed with making money, threatens to tell the people of cana that marcellus crucified jesus, which drives marcellus to beat abidor and send him away violently. the next day marcellus is furious with jonathan for giving his donkey to his physically challenged friend david, because he did not yet understand the teachings of jesus. miriam, who is sitting nearby kindly confronts marcellus, and urges him to see peter , who has come to cana with a greek companion. marcellus guesses that this is demetrius and goes off to shalum\\'s inn to confront him. marcellus finds demetrius alone, and demands that he get the robe and destroy it. demetrius gives the robe to marcellus, who refuses to touch it, and demetrius tells him that if he wants it destroyed, he will have to destroy it himself. marcellus picks the robe up with his sword, and as he becomes frozen with fear, the robe slides down the sword onto him. he is terrified, but this time, as the robe touches him, he finds that the pain he has been carrying since the robe first touched him vanishes and that he is no longer afraid. he feels the true power of the robe and of the one who wore it. in that moment, marcellus believes in jesus christ, is relieved from the madness of his guilt, and becomes a christian. the two men go outside and justus calls the villagers together and begins to introduce peter. justus tells the gathered crowd that, on the night of jesus\\' arrest, only peter stood by jesus. peter tries to correct justus but justus tells peter that his turn to speak will come and continues. suddenly, justus is pierced by an arrow and falls. the assembly turns to see paulus and a large detachment of roman soldiers, with the gloating abidor lurking among them. several other villagers are killed before marcellus intervenes, ordering them to stop. paulus informs him that his orders are no longer valid; tiberias is dead and caligula is emperor. marcellus informs paulus that an imperial commission is valid even after a roman emperor dies. paulus tells marcellus to make him obey via a sword duel. marcellus asks paulus if he will keeps his word to withdraw the troops if marcellus wins the duel. paulus says that if marcellus wins, the troops are his because paulus will be dead. marcellus accepts the challenge to a duel. after a prolonged struggle marcellus prevails. rather than killing paulus, as is expected of him, marcellus hurls his sword into a tree. he challenges paulus to give the order to his soldiers to withdraw. paulus, recognizing the mercy extended to him by marcellus, salutes marcellus and orders the soldiers to leave. peter invites marcellus to join him and demetrius as missionaries. marcellus hesitates, and when peter tells him that he denied jesus three times on the night he was arrested, marcellus confesses his role in jesus\\' death. peter points out to him that jesus forgave him from the cross in the dramatic words showcased before, \"father, forgive them for they know not what they do\" . marcellus then pledges his life to jesus and agrees to go with them. their missionary journey takes them through antioch, ephesus, corinth, and then to rome, but they must proceed \"undercover\" with their base in the catacombs because the emperor caligula has proscribed them. in rome, caligula summons diana from her retreat at the gallio home to tell her that marcellus has become a traitor to rome by being a christian. he takes her to the guard room where a captured demetrius is being tortured. diana runs out of the palace to marcipor , the gallio family slave, who is a secret christian. diana guesses that marcipor is a christian and has seen marcellus, and she gets him to take her to marcellus. marcellus and diana are reunited, and marcellus tells her the story of the robe and his own conversion but diana only thinks the story of jesus, justice, and love is a nice story but that the world doesn\\'t work that way. diana gives marcellus information on where demetrius is in the imperial palace, and marcellus and his fellow christians manage to rescue him. they are almost too late as demetrius is near death, but peter comes to the gallio home where demetrius has been taken and heals him. caligula scolds his roman soldiers for letting the prisoner get away and issues orders to bring marcellus to him alive to stand trial by the end of the day or they will all be sent to the galleys. a physician friend of senator gallio, marius , is called in to help demetrius, but is unable to heal him. marius states that science has limits. marcellus prays to god and peter then knocks on the door and ask to be alone with demetrius. peter lays his hand on demetrius and heals him. marius, a proud man, is resentful of peter\\'s ability to heal demetrius and leaves with the purpose of betraying marcellus to caligula. marcellus tells his father, senator gallio, that he wants to return and tell his father more about christianity; however, his father says this will be the last time they see each other because he feels his son has betrayed rome by becoming a christian and, therefore, he no longer has a son. marcellus promises diana that he will send for her tomorrow and kisses diana as he leaves. marcellus flees with demetrius but, when they are pursued by soldiers, marcellus gives himself up so that demetrius can escape. he is captured and put on trial. diana visit marcellus in prison on the night before his trial and requests he not defy caligula. marcellus tells diana of miriam, the crippled girl who found herself fortunate to be lame; of the poor, young boy jonathan, to whom marcellus gave the fine donkey and he then selflessly gave it away to another boy without a second thought; and how other christians do not deny christ to save their skin. diana wants to believe but does not feel she can if marcellus dies. if he dies now, diana tells him, that she feels his death would be for nothing and that she needs marcellus. caligula makes diana sit next to him for marcellus\\' trial. he then tells the crowd of senators and roman nobles that there is a secret party of seditionists called \"christians\" and how their actions are comparable to the traitor spartacus. he then tells them that one of their own, marcellus, has joined these \"conspirators\" and thus is being tried by all of them for treason. marcellus informs the crowd that it is true that he is a christian; however, he denies the charge that christians are plotting against the state. when caligula says that christians believe jesus is a king, marcellus tells everyone that jesus is a king but that his kingdom is not of this world and jesus seeks to reign in the hearts and mind in the name of justice and charity. caligula asks about the robe that marcellus is holding and marcellus tries to show caligula his opportunity to accept christ. marcellus tries to hand the robe to caligula but caligula refuses to touch it as he considers it to be \"bewitched\". he orders one of his soldiers to take the robe and destroy it, but diana asks to keep it instead. marcellus informs caligula that, if rome turns to the ways of justice and charity, then rome will be saved; however, if rome stayed on its present course, then it would be destroyed. to the crowd, this sounds treasonous and caligula condemns marcellus to death by the wish of the members of the audience based on what they\\'ve heard. caligula, in an effort to show mercy to marcellus, tells him to renew his allegiance to rome and renounce his faith in jesus christ. marcellus kneels to caligula to renew his pledge to rome, a pledge he states that he has never broken, but then stands and states that he cannot renounce his belief in jesus. marcellus tells caligula that jesus is his king and caligula\\'s king and that jesus is the son of god. diana then accepts christ, and seeks to join marcellus, the man she considers to be her husband, in his kingdom. when caligula tells diana that there are no charges against her, she provides a reason for her to be charged with the same crime as marcellus by telling the audience how evil an emperor caligula is. caligula screams out as she states her condemnation of his rules and then condemns diana to die alongside marcellus. as diana and marcellus are marched out of the emperor\\'s court, diana hands the robe to marcipor. diana and marcellus pause to smile at each other as they peacefully walk out of the courtroom to meet their earthly fate. a chorus of \"hallelujah\" plays and clouds are in the background behind diana and marcellus as the film ends.',\n",

out all its inconsistencies. as they shoot the breeze at rachel's house, lamar casually hypothesizes that rachel killed rupert with the help of one of her many boyfriends. he tells kyle that rachel is well known for wrapping men around her finger, and that, with the millions she would inherit from rupert, it was highly likely that she got one of her boyfriends to help her kill rupert and dispose of

       " 'u.s. army major general partridge  appears before the house armed services committee to defend his recent actions; the story is told mostly as a series of flashbacks: in its latest effort to curtail excessive spending by the pentagon, congress appoints an outsider, usaf lieutenant colonel james burton  to observe the testing of several new weapons in development, including the bradley. burton reports to general partridge, who is overseeing the bradley. portrayed as an innocent, burton quickly becomes disillusioned by the \"real\" way the development process works, in an atmosphere of corruption and/or bureaucratic inefficiency. burton witnesses generals, including partridge, reviewing other inefficient  projects with secretary of defence caspar weinberger - such as the m247 sergeant york and the a-12 avenger ii.  insisting on getting fully up to speed on the bradley, burton delves into the mountains of paper documenting the bradley\\'s development history: originally developed as an armored personnel carrier by colonel robert l. smith , the bradley, after being subjected to the changing  demands of a panel of armchair generals, is transformed into a hybrid of a troop carrier, a scout vehicle, and an anti-tank weapon platform. to make room for the weaponry, its complement of troops is reduced from eleven to six men; and despite its firepower, it has to be made of lightweight aluminum to serve as a scout vehicle. in the incredulous summation of burton and his assistant, sgt. fanning , the finished bradley is \"a troop transport that can\\'t carry troops, a reconnaissance vehicle that\\'s too conspicuous to do reconnaissance, and a quasi-tank that has less armor than a snowblower, but carries enough ammo to take out half of d.c.\" by the time general partridge is put in charge of the project, the bradley has been in development for seventeen years, at a cost of $14 billion.  in attempting to meet the demands of his superiors, smith has labored for eleven years without promotion or advancement; when the bradley is finally approved, he gets his long-awaited promotion to brigadier general. smith is a living example of how difficult, if not impossible, it is to develop weapons in an above-board manner; now, as he acerbically explains to colonel burton, since completing weapons is the only path to promotion, or lucrative positions in the private sector, the majority of the pentagon\\'s officials prefer to fake test results, and pass defective weapons and equipment on to the troops in the field. burton is disbelieving, until he insists on testing whether the bradley can stand up to fire under combat conditions. partridge and his two cronies, colonel bach  and major sayers ([[tom wright , manipulate every test result - for example, by filling the fuel tanks with water instead of gasoline, filling the ammunition with sand instead of propellant, and confiscating a cartload of sheep killed by toxic fumes inside the vehicle when its hull combusts. burton confronts sergeant dalton , in charge of the testing range, who admits being ordered to manipulate the test results, but bitterly tells colonel burton that every officer who tries to conduct honest tests eventually buckles under the pressure to gain his next promotion. but burton refuses to approve the bradley without a live-fire test, insisting that the current version of the vehicle is a death trap. eventually, partridge pulls strings to get burton fired. but smith leaks the information to the press, and the resulting scandal leads to the current hearings. despite partridge\\'s denials, the house committee approves burton\\'s request for a live-fire test. the night before the test, burton visits the barracks on the range, and tells dalton and his men that, regardless of whatever orders they have received from partridge or his cronies, it is their duty to their fellow soldiers to make sure the test is performed honestly, driving home his point with an anecdote about the horrific casualties caused by defective m-16 rifles issued to american soldiers during the early years of the vietnam war. on the day of the test, which partridge, bach, and sayers fully expect to confirm their side of the story, dalton and his men have actually made sure the bradley is in fighting condition. when hit by a soviet anti-tank round, the vehicle explodes spectacularly. dalton and his men confide to burton that they had already put the bradley in the right state before he gave them the speech. in a postscript, it is explained that the bradley was extensively redesigned in response to burton\\'s demands, which significantly reduced casualties from its use during the persian gulf war. however, the system was too strong: partridge and his cronies earned their promotions and lucrative private sector jobs, while colonel burton was forced to retire.',\n",

       " \"the film chronicles the 2000 us presidential election aftermath, centering on the contested ballots of the state of florida. many democratic and leftist supporters, campaign workers, and citizens were interviewed regarding the possible exclusion of many valid ballots. according to the film, secretary of the state of florida katherine harris and her associates used a wide ranging data collection system to prevent ineligible voters  from casting a ballot; the controversy stems from the claims that the data system excluded many people who were eligible to vote. the film offers evidence that many people who share a name and nothing else with an ex-con in a state were denied their right to vote. the cases of mistaken identity were not discovered until citizens reached the polls, when it was too late to prove their identity and correct the mistake. the film then attempts to draw connections among governor jeb bush, katherine harris, and the republican party , to make the case that they conspired ahead of the election to deny african americans their right to vote, by exploiting the flawed data system that excludes ex-cons and ineligible voters. reasoning that african americans typically vote heavily in favor of democratic candidates, the republicans worked to exclude these votes to capture the state's electoral votes, the film argues. another area of contention brought up by the film is that recounts were only taken in certain counties, not statewide; again, this is suggested to be a republican tactic due to the evidence presented by the film which claims that the recounts in those counties were vastly different from the original count.\",\n",

runs to help her, and once inside, he meets her husband thomas , and they make friar a cup of tea. as they are sitting in the living room, friar explains who he is looking for and reaches for the picture in order to show it to the quarres. however, it blew away as he helped mrs. quarre with the groceries, and as he fumbles for it, hoop  emerges and points a gun to his head. friar is tied to a chair and a criminal plot quickly emerges, although the nature of it and the roles of the people in the house are unclear. the quarres seem to be innocent quasi-hostages, much like himself. hoop appears to be the near psychotic muscle man. the femme fatale is revealed to be a woman named erin  who is involved with the ringleader tyrone . when tyrone is in the garden at one point, erin and hoop talk about running away together after their crime has been committed. the doorbell rings and it is a banker named david , who is the inside man for the heist. erin informs him that the crime has been moved forward to today, and david thinks it\\'s impossible. erin says that it\\'s the only way for the two of them to be together, and he agrees to help the team rob the bank ahead of schedule. tyrone dispatches the quarres to the airfield where they are to prepare a small plane for their escape to the caribbean. he assigns erin to stay at the house and guard friar. she points out that david will expect to see her at the bank, but tyrone insists that he can handle david. tyrone and hoop leave for the bank. alone in the house together, erin appears extremely sympathetic to friar\\'s plight. she explains that if she let him go, tyrone would kill her. she shows friar her right foot which is missing the second toe, claiming that tyrone cut it off when she tried to leave him. at the bank, hoop infiltrates the electrical system and causes a total blackout, leaving only the phone lines open. tyrone impersonates a blind man making a $10 million transfer out of the bank, insisting that the transfer absolutely must happen by 6:00 pm. during the blackout, he uses david as a foil against the bank manager, pretending to be outraged that his transfer cannot go through. david offers to make the transfer on his laptop through a modem, much to his manager\\'s relief. the manager hands tyrone a disc with all the various account numbers and passwords for the transfers, but as tyrone pretends to miss it with his outstretched hand due to his blindness, david grabs the disc. as david walks tyrone out of the bank, he insists that he must see erin before he hands over the disc, despite this being a departure from the plan. tyrone and hoop decide to go to david\\'s house and ambush him. meanwhile, on turk street, the lack of food has made friar pass out. erin realizes he is a diabetic and tries to revive him by dripping orange juice into his mouth. out of desperation, she grabs his keys and wallet and drives his car to his apartment, where she finds his insulin in the refrigerator. back at the house, she injects friar and saves him from falling into a diabetic coma. friar thanks her for saving his life and says that he owes her one. erin comments on the packed bags that she noticed at friar\\'s apartment, and she reveals that she brought his cello back with her. erin sits at the piano and begins to play a halting version of chopsticks, by the end, she is playing a sophisticated, jazzlike version of the piece, revealing that she is also a musician. she explains that tyrone rescued her from a collapsing russia, where most of her friends went on to become prostitutes. pointing the gun at friar, she says she\\'ll collect the debt he owes her for saving his life by making him play with her. she gives him a copy of henri duparc\\'s chanson triste, and he sight reads it with her accompanying on piano. afterward, he sits behind her and teaches her to play the cello. the two almost kiss, but friar decides against it. he clearly has fallen for erin, but the extent is unclear. he allows her to tie him up again, presumably so she will not be killed by tyrone. at david\\'s house, hoop gets nowhere by roughing up the poor banker. he has password-protected the contents of the disc, and he refuses to divulge the password unless he sees erin. hoop brings erin to david\\'s house, leaving friar alone on turk street. david insists on being alone with erin, who coyly tries to hew to the plan that she leave with tyrone for the caribbean, returning for david in a few days. he wants to go with them, but erin points out that he can\\'t be seen with tyrone ever again, promising that she\\'ll return for him. david says, \"enough promises\", and the two of them make love for the first time. hoop gets more and more agitated as time goes by, finally barging into the room. enraged by the sight of erin and david in bed, he kills david without getting the password. erin correctly guesses that the password is her name, and the three of them get in a car together, where tyrone reveals that they are not going to meet the quarres at the airfield. realizing her various escape plans were being cut off, erin concocts a story that friar was lying about looking for a girl and was in fact looking for tyrone, convincing tyrone that they must return to turk street and kill him. friar has loosened his bonds, and when hoop attempts to strangle him, friar stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, killing him. tyrone puts a gun in erin\\'s hand, trying to make her pull the trigger as her \\'baptism\\', when the quarres burst in with guns. the couple realized that they were being abandoned and want their cut of the bank money. as mr. quarre tries to take the disc from tyrone, his shotgun goes off, killing mrs. quarre. mr. quarre is heartbroken and kills himself with her pistol. friar convinces tyrone, who is clearly averse to shedding blood himself, that as a cop, he can help them with their escape plan. the crew will drive to albany and then on to the canadian border, and friar asserts that with the siren in his car and his badge, he can help them get to the border without incident. he asks that erin be allowed to choose her own path from there: whether to be with friar or tyrone. tyrone agrees, riding in the back seat with a shotgun aimed at friar\\'s back. tyrone reveals that the $10 million has been transferred into multiple banks around albany in smaller amounts which won\\'t attract the attention that the original sum would. the trio spend the morning going to the various banks withdrawing the funds in cashier\\'s checks. in order to still have the advantage over friar, tyrone calls each bank in advance and convinces them to allow him to withdraw the funds at the drive-thru. at one of the banks, friar says that a security guard has written down their license plate number, convincing tyrone that they need to stop and steal some new ones. on the way to canada, erin slides into the backseat with tyrone, signaling that she will choose him, but she slips a pistol to friar in the front seat. at the canadian border, as they wait in line behind the other cars, friar insists that the time has come for tyrone to let them go. he turns around with the pistol and tyrone fires the shotgun. friar has placed the old license plates behind his back, shielding him from the blast. as tyrone runs for the border with the shotgun, he is gunned down by the border police. friar has to choose whether or not to turn erin in, since only he knows if she was a hostage or a conspirator. she reminds him of how they almost kissed and says that they\\'ve each got their $1 million share of the cashier\\'s checks which they could use to run away together. friar reveals that he has torn his up and allows her to walk away. as she is leaving the border station, he tells a cop to arrest her.',\n",

       " 'on mars in the year 2046, in the union aerospace corporation  olduvai research facility, scientists are attacked and pulled into the darkness by an unseen monster. doctor carmack ([[robert russell  transmits a warning about a level 5 security breach before the door behind him is torn open. he turns around and sees a large humanoid creature through the gap. on earth, a team of eight marines -  known as the rrts hellfighters  are preparing to go on leave. their leave is cancelled when the squad leader, sarge , receives new orders. contact with olduvai has been lost and the rrts is being sent to investigate. the mars station is quarantined and the 85 uac employees on mars are not allowed to return to earth. as the men suit up, sarge pulls aside john \"reaper\" grimm  and asks him not to go because olduvai is where reaper\\'s parents died and his sister is still on the station. reaper suits up anyway, and their team is deployed to mars via a teleportation device called the \"ark\", located at area 51. the ark was discovered in 2026, and scientists have been studying it. the team meets an early victim of the ark system, pinky , who \"went to one galaxy while his ass went to another\" during an ark teleportation event . they meet up with dr. samantha grimm , reaper\\'s sister. she briefs the rrts that doctor carmacks division of the facility focused on genetic research has been quarantined off, with carmack and five other scientists sealed inside. sarge instructs his team that their mission is to eliminate the threat, secure the facility and retrieve uac property; dr. grimm going into the genetics lab with the squad to recover carmack\\'s research data. reaper converses with his sister and learns that they discovered humanoid remains on mars, which, unlike humans, have an extra chromosome pair which granted them invulnerability to disease as well as advanced cellular regeneration. the team locates carmack, who has gone mad to the point of tearing off his own ear. they return him to the lab and grimm sedates him. the marines explore the facility, encountering two of the five remaining scientists only to discover that they have been transformed into zombies, forcing them to kill them. after spotting and chasing a large creature through the facility, the team follows it into the sewer system, discovering the bloodied lab coat of a \\'doctor steve willits\\'. whilst the team is split up, an imp ambushes goat  and causes a mortal wound on his throat before being killed by reaper and brought to dr. grimm, alongside the wounded goat. despite the best efforts of the rrts, goat dies in the lab. in response to the event, sarge orders the 85 workers in the facility to evacuate back to earth through the ark with the exception of dr. grimm and pinky, the latter being left to guard the ark. after the evacuations are complete, duke  remains with dr. grimm whilst she examines the remains of the imp, and the two notice that doctor carmack has vanished from the infirmary. moments later outside the lab they are attacked by an imp which manages to lightly wound duke before dr. grimm closes a nanowall on the creature, keeping it alive but trapping it halfway through the wall. shortly afterwards, dr. grimm conducts an autopsy of the deceased imp and discovers that it was once human. a second later duke notices that goat has returned to life as a zombie and broken free of the body bag containing him. retaining some shred of his humanity and aware that he is turning, goat prevents it by violently smashing his head into the observation room window to kill himself once again. meanwhile, the rest of the rrts return to the genetics lab and begin exploring the archeological digsite in the facility. while searching the caverns, the team discovers the bodies of two more of carmack\\'s scientists, leaving only doctor willits still unaccounted for. while sarge and reaper examine the bodies, mac  is ambushed and immediately decapitated by the hell knight, the large humanoid monster seen prior. convinced that the team is going to need some additional firepower to take on the creature, sarge uses the severed hand of one of the scientists and takes the bio force gun, dubbing it the \"big fucking gun.\" elsewhere, portman  leaves his post to use the restroom, leaving destroyer  alone. in reality, portman is going against sarge\\'s orders to maintain quarantine by sending out a transmission to earth to request rrts reinforcements. at the same time, destroyer is attacked by the hell knight and thrown into a pit with electrified walls used as a prison cell. the two engage in a brutal melee fight before destroyer manages to pin the hell knight to the electrified wall with a large pipe, attempting to climb a hanging chain out of the pit. unfortunately as he reaches the top, the hell knight breaks loose and pulls the chain down, causing destroyer to fall to his death. shortly after the fight concludes, portman successfully sends his transmission to earth and is abruptly attacked by the hell knight which proceeds to hang him upside down from the ceiling and smash him violently through the stall walls. by time the rest of the rrts arrive to help him he is dead and sarge fails to hit the hell knight with the bfg before it retreats again. after being brought the bodies of portman and destroyer, dr. grimm determines that the genetics of the creatures have been altered by the addition of the 24th martian chromosome, which led to their mutations and that the chromosome is spread by the ovipositors of those infected. she also reveals that the imp trapped halfway through the nanowall is in fact doctor carmack, as identified due to his missing ear. she theorizes that the imp killed in the sewers is the missing doctor willits. losing his patience with grimm, sarge executes the transformed carmack and interrogates her for an explanation of their research. after reviewing the research data grimm collected from carmack\\'s lab, video footage is discovered which reveals that carmack and his team deliberately injected the chromosome into a man named curtis stahl, a prisoner convicted of multiple murders before being given to the uac instead of facing execution. the footage revealed that stahl mutated into the hell knight, which led to him breaking loose and killing / infecting the research team. with four men kia, the squad is reduced to sarge, reaper, the kid , and duke. the team realize that the hell knight is cutting through the vault door into the ark in an attempt to escape to earth. sarge orders pinky to detonate an st grenade that mac left him to destroy the ark and prevent it from getting through. however, pinky fails to and instead retreats through the ark back to earth and the hell knight chases him through. sarge confirms the mission is no longer containment and orders the rrts to head back to earth to eliminate the hell knight. reaper returns to the lab to bring dr. grimm, who reveals that the ovipositor of the creatures are selectively choosing what humans to infect. reaper and dr. grimm theorize that the creatures pick up on genetic markers to make their decision, impulsively trying to infect people with \"evil\" tendencies  while ignoring those with more of a \"good\" personality . dr. grimm explains that the 24th chromosome would turn \"good\" people into super humans like the remains found on mars, while those who are \"evil\" are turned into monsters. meanwhile, the rest of the rrts reach the uac facility on earth and find it full of corpses, the researchers from olduvai and the base staff having been slaughtered by the hell knight when it came through. with the facility on automatic lock down to prevent anyone from leaving, the rrts have a single hour before the lock down is lifted and the creatures can escape the facility. sarge orders his men to kill anything alive in order to prevent the infection from spreading, leading them on a cleanup operation through the facility that leads them to kill a considerable number of uac employees transformed into zombies. however, sarge shows no distinction between targets and even kills survivors who do not show immediate signs of infection. while confirming the bodies in the facility are really dead, duke discovers pinky hiding under a pile of bodies and brings him back to the ark chamber where reaper and dr. grimm are trying to convince sarge that not everyone is capable of being infected due to their \"good\" genes. sarge doesn\\'t heed them and prepares to execute pinky before the kid rushes into the room, stating that he found a large group of non-infected humans. sarge orders him to return and kill them but the kid refuses, resulting in sarge executing him for insubordination. reaper prepares to retaliate for the murder before pinky aims a pistol at sarge, ordering him to drop his rifle. the stand off is abruptly cut short when the hell knight enters the room, grabbing pinky and fleeing into the halls with him in tow. the rrts attempt to chase the creature down before they run directly into a horde of zombies, making their stand at a nanowall that is malfunctioning and failing to shut. duke is suddenly pulled through a vent in the floor by an imp and killed while the zombies drag sarge through the nanowall. just then, the nanowall shuts and reaper is hit in the gut by a ricochet from his own rifle. the two siblings flee the area and barricade themselves in a storage room. to save reaper\\'s life, dr. grimm injects reaper with chomosome 24. instead of becoming a monster, reaper awakens as a superhuman with enhanced speed, strength and healing abilities, his gunshot wound and other inflicted injuries having healed. following reaper\\'s transformation and the discovery that dr. grimm is missing, the movie takes on a first-person shooter perspective. within a few minutes, reaper moves through the facility and slays an array of zombies and imps, eventually having a showdown with the hell knight after severely burning it. reaper successfully manages to kill the hell knight when he detonates a planted mine at its feet, blowing it to pieces. shortly after, reaper is attacked by pinky, who has now transformed into a demon after the hell knight infected him. after an intense and brutal fight, reaper manages to incapacitate pinky with the hell knight\\'s chainsaw and proceeds to finish him off with his rifle. switching back to a standard camera angle, reaper emerges at the facility\\'s exit. bodies are scattered everywhere, and a melted blue hole in the wall, the mark of a bfg blast, is still cooling. reaper finds dr. grimm lying on the floor, injured but alive. sarge then appears, seemingly none the worse for wear, but reaper notices the same injury on sarge that carmack had before he turned into an imp. when asked what happened to the non-infected survivors, sarge replies that he \"took care of that problem\"- he has killed them. reaper tells dr. grimm to crawl to the elevator to the surface, intent on not letting sarge leave the facility with the lock down only minutes from being lifted. after spending their last ammunition- reaper\\'s half of a magazine and sarge\\'s one round in the bfg, the two marines battle hand to hand in the ark chamber with their superhuman abilities. as sarge manages to pin reaper against a wall, he begins transforming, developing features such as a prominent skull structure, sharp teeth and yellow eyes. without any other choice, reaper activates the ark and throws sarge through, followed by a grenade. sarge lands back in the mars facility and soon notices the grenade. he and the ark are obliterated in the explosion. reaper retrieves dr. grimm, who is conscious but unable to walk, and holds her in his arms as he returns to the earth\\'s surface.',\n",

lieutenant ignores. in the next scene, the detective approaches a group of drug dealers, who run off as he approaches. the lieutenant follows one dealer into an apartment building and up the stairs. the dealer waits for him in the hallway, and the lieutenant gives him a bag of drugs from a crime scene. the lieutenant quickly smokes some crack, and then sets aside a portion of the drugs for himself. the thief promises to give him the money he makes from selling the drugs in a few days. at an apartment, the lieutenant gets drunk and engages in a threesome with two women. meanwhile, a nun  is raped in a church by two young hoodlums. in the hospital, the lieutenant spies on her naked body as she is examined by the doctors, who explain that the two boys also raped her with objects like a crucifix. the lieutenant listens to her statement, where she says she has no feelings of animosity towards her attackers. she sees the attack as an opportunity for god\\'s grace to be bestowed on

his wager on the next game in the series. the mets have lost the first three games, and he is certain that the dodgers will win again. his wager now stands at $30,000, more than he can afford to pay. as the film progresses, his drug use and drinking becomes more prolific and his behavior spins out of control. he is drinking and driving while he listens to the final moments of the next game in the pennant series. when the dodgers lose again, he shoots out his car stereo. at another crime scene, he rifles through the car and finds some drugs which he stashes in his suit jacket. however, he is too impaired to secure the drugs, and they fall out onto the street. his colleagues look at him in horror, and he tries to play it off by instructing them to enter the drugs into evidence. at the first communion of one of his children, he doubles his wager again on the series, bringing his potential losings to $60,000. the friend who places his bets for him urges him not to deepen his predicament, but the lieutenant is positive that the mets cannot continue to win, as no team has ever come back from three straight losses to begin a series. as his criminality deepens, the lieutenant pulls over two young girls who have borrowed their father\\'s car to go to a club. without proper licenses, he forces the girls to strip and simulate oral sex while he masturbates. after the mets win game 6 of the series, he tries to double his wager again. his friend refuses to make the wager, insisting that the bookie would kill him for nothing, and it would be suicidal to owe him $120,000. the lieutenant is unwavering in his belief that the mets cannot win the series, and he appears to heavily identify with darryl strawberry, whose at-bats are the only real action shown from the series. he calls the bookie to place the bet, and the bookie says he will think about taking it. continuing his drug use, the lieutenant picks up his $30,000 share from the drug dealer who sold the evidence he had stolen. he then goes to the church where the nun was raped and finds her kneeling in prayer before the altar. in a near-stupor from his drinking and drug use, he tells her that most cops would just run her attackers through the system but that if she will identify them he will give her justice, implying that he will kill them for her. she repeats that she has forgiven them already then gets up and leaves the lieutenant alone on his knees at the altar. the lieutenant suffers an emotional breakdown. he sees the crucified christ standing in the aisle of the church and, in tears, begins to

       " 'the piano tells the story of a mute scotswoman, ada mcgrath , whose father sells her into marriage to a new zealand frontiersman, alistair stewart . she is shipped off along with her young daughter flora mcgrath . the voice that the audience hears is not her speaking voice, but her mind\\'s voice. ada has not spoken a word since she was six years old, expressing herself instead through her piano playing and through sign language for which her daughter has served as the interpreter. ada cares little for the mundane world, occupying herself for hours every day with the piano. it is never made explicitly clear why she ceased to speak. flora, it is later learned, is the product of a relationship with a teacher whom ada believed she could control with her mind, making him love her, but who \"became frightened and stopped listening,\" and thus left her. ada, flora, and their belongings, including the piano, are deposited on a new zealand beach by the ship\\'s crew against her angry objections. as there is no one there to meet them, they spend the night alone, sheltering under a tiny tent made of a hoop skirt frame. the following day, alistair arrives with a māori crew and his friend baines , a fellow forester and a retired sailor, who has adopted many of the māori customs, including tattooing his face and socializing with the māori instead of his own race . there are insufficient men to carry everything and alistair abandons the piano, again eliciting objections from ada. alistair proves to be a shy and diffident man, who is jokingly called \"old dry balls\" by his māori cohorts. he tells ada that there is no room in his small house for the piano. ada, in turn, makes no effort to befriend him and continues to try to be reunited with her piano. unable to communicate with alistair, she goes, with flora, to baines and asks to be taken to the piano. he agrees, and the three spend the day as she plays tunes on the beach. while he socially aligns himself with the māori, baines has steadfastly refused any sexual activity with māori women. but he clearly finds ada attractive due to her passion for music. baines eventually retrieves the instrument and suggests that alistair trade it{{mdash}}and lessons from ada{{mdash}}for some land that alistair wants. alistair consents, oblivious to the budding attraction between ada and baines. she is surprised to find that he has had the piano put into perfect tune after its rough journey. he asks to simply listen rather than learn to play himself, and then offers to let her buy the piano back, one key at a time, by letting him do \"things he likes\" while she plays. ada reluctantly agrees, as she is attracted to baines. ada and alistair have had no sexual, or even mildly affectionate, interaction even though they are betrothed to marry. baines is sexually aroused by ada\\'s playing to the point that he openly approaches her. finally, she yields to her own desire one afternoon, and she and baines have intercourse. alistair finally begins to suspect the love affair and after discovering them, he angrily boards up his home with ada inside when he goes off to work on his timberland. after that interlude, ada avoids baines and feigns affection with alistair, though her caresses only serve to frustrate him more because when he makes a move to touch her in return, she pulls away. before alistair departs on his next journey, he asks ada if she will go to see baines{{mdash}}she shakes her head no{{mdash}}and he tells her he trusts that she won\\'t go to him while he\\'s gone. soon after, ada sends her daughter with a package for baines, containing a single piano key with an inscribed love declaration that says \"dear george, you will have my heart, ada mcgrath\". flora has begun to accept alistair as her \"papa\" and is angered by her mother\\'s infidelity. she brings the piano key instead to alistair. after reading the love note burnt onto the piano key, alistair furiously returns home and cuts off ada\\'s index finger with an axe to deprive her of the ability to play her piano. he then sends flora to baines with the severed finger wrapped in cloth, with the

       " 'the opening scene of the film explains the origins of u.s.-saudi diplomatic relations and how the discovery of energy resources has transformed the middle east through a timeline sequence. it portrays the conflicts that have risen since the late 1940s for the rightful ownership of the oil industry. this includes the persian gulf war in iraq and al-qaeda\\'s growing network of terrorism. eventually, it explains the 9/11 terrorist attacks and how the majority of the hijackers were saudis. this raises serious questions on the relationship between saudi arabia and the united states. the plot begins with the current struggle of saudi arabia and the kingdom\\'s efforts to stand control of their country against terrorist extremists. during a softball game at an american oil company housing compound in riyadh, saudi arabia, al-qaeda terrorists set off a bomb, killing many americans and saudis in the process. the terrorists impersonate members of the saudi state police. while one team hijacks a car and shoots at the residents of the area, another runs out onto the softball diamond, pretending to aid the americans, but then reveals that he is a suicide bomber and blows himself up, killing everyone near him. sergeant haytham  of the saudi state police, disables the stolen saudi police vehicle and kills the terrorists. a short time later, the fbi legal attaché in saudi arabia, special agent francis manner , calls up his colleague special agent ronald fleury  to tell him about the attack. shortly afterwards, a second bomb explodes in the compound killing manner and more people. at fbi headquarters in washington, d.c., fleury briefs his rapid deployment team on the attack and casualties. during the briefing, special agent janet mayes , a forensic examiner, breaks down in tears upon hearing of francis\\' death. fleury whispers something into her ear which causes her to control her emotions. while the u.s. justice department and the u.s. state department hinder fbi efforts to investigate the attack, fleury blackmails the saudi ambassador into allowing an fbi investigative team into saudi arabia. departing from andrews air force base, fleury and his team of mayes, adam leavitt , an intelligence analyst and special agent grant sykes ([[chris cooper , a bomb technician, go to saudi arabia. arriving at prince sultan air base, they are met by colonel faris al-ghazi , the commander of the saudi state police force providing security at the compound. fleury soon realizes that colonel al-ghazi is not in charge of running the investigation. in actuality, the investigation is being run by general al abdulmalik  of the saudi national guard, who does not give fleury and his team permission to investigate. rather, they are to observe the saudi investigation. when the fbi team is invited to the palace of saudi prince ahmed bin khaled  for a dinner, mayes is excluded because of her sex. while at the palace, fleury persuades the prince that colonel al-ghazi is a natural detective and should be allowed to lead the investigation. with this new change in leadership, the americans are allowed a more hands-on approach to the crime scene. while searching for evidence, sergeant haytham and sykes discover that the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance, using marbles as projectiles. fleury learns that the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms. colonel al-ghazi orders a swat team to raid the house, managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists. following the raid, the team discovers valuable intelligence, including multiple photos of the u.s. and other western embassies in riyadh. soon afterwards, fleury and his team are notified by the u.s. embassy deputy chief of mission damon schmidt  that they have been ordered to return to the united states. however, fleury and al-ghazi both believed that the men that they had just killed were just amateur fighters and were not the real planners behind the attacks. on their way to king khalid international airport, fleury notices a youth watching their convoy from an overpass, and then sees that the last suv of their convoy has slowed down falling far behind. he then notices a speeding car coming towards them and grabs the wheel from sergeant haytham, which allows them to partially evade the collision that occurs when the speeding car runs into the first suv of their convoy, setting off a trunk full of explosives. their suv, the third one in their convoy, hits the first suv, killing the men inside. the fourth suv finally drives up and the men inside pull out leavitt, throwing him into the back and driving away while a second car drives by to shoot the surviving americans. fleury manages to wound one attacker, and al-ghazi commandeers a civilian vehicle to chase the fourth suv and the other car into the dangerous suweidi neighborhood of riyadh. as they pull up, a gunman launches rocket-propelled grenades at them and a fierce firefight starts. inside the complex, leavitt is tied up and gagged while his attackers prepare to film a tape of them executing him by beheading. after having killed their attackers, al-ghazi decides that three of them must enter and find leavitt and two must stay behind and cover the entrance. while sykes and haytham watch the entrance, al-ghazi, fleury and mayes enter the building, following a blood trail and manage to finish off many other gunmen inside. mayes, separate from the other two, scares a little girl in an apartment, and she enters to find a family with little children, their mother and grandfather. she yells at them to stay put and goes across the hall to another apartment to find leavitt and his attackers. she kills the remaining insurgents, and al-ghazi and the team start to leave. however, mayes feels unsettled about the little girl, and walks in to give the girl a lollipop. in return, the girl gives her a marble, matching the ones pieced together earlier from the bomb scene. fleury then realises that there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment, and al-ghazi sees the grandfather, suspects something and asks to help him up in order to inspect his hand. when the old man gives him his hand, al-ghazi sees that the man is missing the fingers thatabu hamza al-masri  born mustafa kamel mustafa are missing in the terrorist group\\'s many videos and confirms his idea that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. abu hamza\\'s teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and manages to shoot al-ghazi in the neck twice with a pistol before it jams, then he begins to point his gun at mayes, prompting fleury to kill him. abu hamza then feebly pulls out an assault rifle and haytham puts three shots in his chest. as abu hamza dies, another grandson hugs him and abu hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. al-ghazi dies in fleury\\'s arms. at al-ghazi\\'s house, fleury and haytham meet his family. fleury tells his son that al-ghazi was his good friend, mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie where he comforted special agent manner\\'s son. fleury and his team return to the u.s., where they are commended by fbi director james grace  for their outstanding work. afterwards, leavitt asks fleury what he had whispered to mayes  to calm her down. the scene cuts to abu hamza\\'s daughter asking her own son what his grandfather whispered to him as he was dying. fleury recalls saying, \"we\\'re gonna kill them all,\" while the grandson tells her mother, \"don\\'t fear them, my child. we are going to kill them all.\", implying a never-ending, vicious cycle resulted from the war.',\n",

       " 'the story follows the escape of two men from an alaska prison, the efforts of a train dispatching office to safely stop the out-of-control train they are on, and the hunt by their warden to recapture them. oscar \"manny\" manheim is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of stonehaven maximum security prison. after two previous escape attempts the doors to manny\\'s cell have been welded shut for three years. a court order compels manny\\'s nemesis, the vindictive associate warden ranken, to release him back into the general prison population. manny immediately sets his next escape plan into action. buck is another convict  who due to his position in the prison\\'s laundry room is recruited to smuggle manny out in a laundry trolley. naive and unintelligent, buck decides to escape with manny, who does not care for company. after a freezing cross-country hike  the two hop on board a train consisting of four locomotives at a remote alaskan rail yard. just as the train is set in motion, the elderly engineer suffers a heart attack. in attempting to stop the train and get off, the engineer does not set the throttle to idle, instead engaging the brakes, before collapsing off the still-moving train. this overrides the engine\\'s automatic train stop. consequently, although the brakes apply, the locomotives overpower them, and the brake shoes burn off, making it impossible to stop the train. neither the two convicts nor the only railway worker left on the train, a locomotive hostler named sara, are aware of their situation . as the train accelerates, dispatcher frank barstow is alerted to the situation. unaware of the failure of the brakes, barstow authorizes employees to allow the runaway out onto the mainline, arrogantly insisting that a computer-controlled signalling system of his creation will trigger a brake application on the locomotives. the last of the brake shoes burn off and the dispatchers realize the severity of their situation, forcing them to keep the tracks clear. the runaway smashes through the caboose of a freight train that was in the act of moving out of its path. the collision badly damages the cab of the lead locomotive and jams the front door of the second engine, an old emd f-unit. as the train accelerates to dangerous speeds, barstow realizes that the locomotive\\'s over-speed control is no longer working properly after the crash. learning that the train\\'s excessive speed will most probably collapse an old railroad trestle ahead, barstow\\'s superior orders him to derail it, believing that no one alive is on board. at this point the signal maintainer hears the train\\'s horn. realizing that someone is indeed alive on the train, barstow orders a reversal of the switch. the speeding train continues onwards towards the aged seneca trestle, where emergency workers are gathering in expectation of a disaster. warden ranken concludes that his two escaped convicts are escaping by rail. meanwhile, the two fugitives have found sara on board when she climbs back to the fourth engine in the belief she will be safer towards the rear of the train in a possible collision. now aware that the engineer must be dead, the three must get to the lead engine so that they can press its fuel cutoff switch. sara informs them that they can\\'t because the second locomotive is a \"carbody\" f-unit with no forward catwalk. its nose door, which would normally allow access to the lead engine, is jammed from the collision with the freight. at her suggestion, they are able to slow the train somewhat by disconnecting the mu cables connected to the two rear locomotives, shutting them down and slowing the train enough for it to safely cross the seneca trestle. the dispatchers divert the runaway onto a branch after determining it is only five minutes away from a head-on collision with a passenger train. this is only a brief respite, as further ahead the branch negotiates a tight curve adjacent to a chemical plant. even at its reduced speed, the runaway is likely to derail on this curve and trigger a major chemical spill. his hand forced, barstow agrees that they must switch the runaway onto a stub-ended siding and crash it, thus sending the three people on the train to almost certain death, rather than risk a catastrophic chemical explosion. warden ranken refuses to wait, coercing barstow\\'s assistance in chasing down the train by prison helicopter. manny shows an increasingly violent streak, repeatedly asserting his dominance over buck. he eventually forces buck to attempt a suicidal scramble around the outside of the second engine\\'s nose . sara\\'s intervention on buck\\'s behalf forces an armed face-off between the two convicts. emotionally broken, all three slump into a fatalistic depressionin the f-unit\\'s cab, only broken when ranken\\'s helicopter catches up with the train. spurred on by the appearance of his arch-foe, and resolved not to return to prison, even if it means his own death, manny makes a perilous leap from the f-unit\\'s broken windshield to the lead engine. there, after a struggle with ranken , manny handcuffs him inside the cab. to the music of the second movement of antonio vivaldi\\'s \"gloria\" in d , manny uncouples the lead engine from the rest of the train, leaving buck and sara safely behind. he refuses to stop the lead engine despite buck\\'s screamed pleas. with ranken his prisoner now, manny climbs onto the roof of the lone engine in the freezing cold and blowing snow, his arms stretched out, ready to meet his end. after a series of cross-cuts of buck and manny\\'s fellow inmates mourning in their cells at stonehaven, the film fades to white and closes with an on-screen quote from william

it is stockpiled for the rich to become immortal. an upset will argues that no one should die before their time naturally ends, upon which hamilton describes how he no longer even desires life, saying \"your mind can be spent, even if your body is not. we want to die. we need to.\" later that night, hamilton transfers 116 years to the sleeping will, keeping only five minutes for himself, then

catches up with will and sylvia outside the city, holding them at gunpoint. having noticed that leon behaves differently from the other timekeepers, will deduces that leon was himself from the ghettos once but had managed to successfully circumvent the system. will jokingly asks leon to return some of the time he previously loaned him so that they can survive until their executions, but leon

concern marlene and she begins to know something is wrong. shortly after returning to second earth, the high council orders the \"sleepers\" on a second offensive against the blue. marlene is separated from yuji once again, but in his current state he does not seem to care. as the \"sleepers\" are carrying out their mission, a battle on second earth between two factions is waged. seno, the head of second earth\\'s science division, leads the \"ark\" rebellion taking control of the military, lunar resource, and education stations of second earth. the high council escapes to and retains control of the medical station. during this time marlene learns about the nature of the illness that put yuji in stasis, the source of his abilities, and the source of the blue insectoids. they are a defense mechanism enacted by the earth to purge the existence of humanity, and the b-cells that exist in the \"sleepers\" could become a potential threat to humanity as well. after the \"ark\" successfully takes over second earth from the ignorant high council, marlene heads down to earth in search of yuji. when she finds him his b-cells are already beginning to activate and he begins to go berserk as a killing machine. after struggling and fighting with him, marlene is finally able to get through to yuji and helps him overcome his madness by showing her human emotions and feelings for him . meanwhile, tony and an unknowing alicia have also abandoned the remaining grounds forces. the troops fend off waves of blue before escaping with the few remaining survivors. tony and a now brainwashed alicia also eventually return to second earth, but bring with them several blue when they board the medical station. when yuji and marlene return to second earth, they find that tony plans to ram the medical station into the military station, which would therefore destroy the heart of second earth. he sees this as the \"grand will of the earth\", in which he will become a \"messiah\" and cleanse the planet of humanity forever. however, yuji, marlene, and a group of other soldiers infiltrate the station, and manage to free alicia\\'s mind after injuring her. later, yuji and marlene confront and eliminate tony, while rick  is slaughtered by a blue. alicia ventures back to tony to die with him as the military destroys the medical station. after the decision by seno\\'s junta to abandon earth, yuji becomes depressed and contemplates his existence, wondering what he has been fighting for, why he was woken, why he cannot save his friends , and what is truly earth\\'s will. however, marlene again is able to get through to yuji and the two realize they need each other and finally become lovers. yuji decides to return to earth to once and for all find out what earth\\'s will is. after learning from seno about a new migration pattern of the blue, yuji and marlene take a group of volunteers and head to an area where a massive nest is located. there they find a group of humans who seem to be surviving in the area. the nest seems impenetrable at first, but they eventually find an entrance with the help of the local people. the entrance leads to a tunnel where the walls, ceiling, and floor of the cavern are composed of fossil-like blue. the team finally comes upon a crystal formation in a massive cavern. a huge blue is birthed from the gel substance sitting atop the formation and kills everyone except for yuji and marlene. yuji kills it and comes to the conclusion that the sphere will hold the answers he seeks. he sends marlene, who is pregnant with their child, away to the surface to wait for him. he then gets a vision and can see what the earth itself can see. yuji comes to understand how mankind can live alongside the b-cells and returns to marlene. meanwhile, second earth\\'s military station\\'s citizens revolt against seno. the station\\'s personnel proceed to abandon the station for earth via shuttles. eventually a firefight erupts over the last remaining overcrowded shuttle, and the station is destroyed by a massive explosion. all around the world from former blue nests, long strings of coalescing energy ascend into earth\\'s atmosphere and form a ring. marlene and yuji watch this, realizing earth is now a safe place to be and look forward to the rest of their lives together as the sun sets. a final view of the earth from space is shown with a slightly garbled narration, presumably by the earth, stating, \"welcome to your next journey\".',\n",

the night with scam, who lives at a hotel managed by a miss hanks , where he works as a maintenance man. she reminds scam that she cannot let him stay any longer, for it is against law for an under aged child to live alone without adult supervision. but scam promises that his father is coming for him. as they are heading to scam's room a hit man named doc , and his assistant dickie , are beating up a man trying to find another man, their target hit, who runs out the door with doc and dickie chasing him. meanwhile, obie asks scam about his dad to which scam replies that he is dead. the next morning, doc and dickie return to the hotel having caught their mark, killed him, and stuffed his body in the trunk of their car, a dark gray colored mercedes-benz. scam then steals their car by using obie as an accomplice. scam drives obie to the bank to get the money for his watch, with both unaware of the body in the trunk. after leaving the bank with the money obie has scam to take him by his house so that he could make sure his mother and sister were okay. while there, they learn that obie's mother has reported him missing to the police. having discovered their car stolen, doc and dickie go around offering a $1000 reward to anyone for the recovery of their car. obie and scam return to the pawn shop to buy obie's watch from keegan. first keegan ups the price by charging taxes, then stiffs them by taking the money and refusing to give obie his watch. scam attempts to get the watch out of the display case himself, but keegan stops him. plus he make a horrible comment about obie's dad, sending him running out the pawn shop upset with scam following after him. obie goes from being upset to being angry, and scam determines that with his fire of emotions both he and obie are ready to get his watch. they head back to scam's room at the hotel, and get some cap guns to use as real guns to scare keegan into giving up obie's watch. on the way out they have an encounter with dickie, then they overhear doc asking miss hanks about the missing car. they take the car and hide it in a garage under a pile of boxes. afterwards they burst in keegan's pawn shop, pointing their cap guns, demanding keegan give up obie's watch. but keegan hits his silent alarm and decides to call their bluff. convinced that the guns are toys he dares them to shoot him. obie then squeezes the trigger, firings off a live round, realizing and revealing the gun he has is in fact real. they force keegan into his own cage and make off with obie's watch, running out the back door. the police show up just as scam runs out the door. he tries to scale the fence to get away but is caught. obie exits seconds after the police grab scam. seeing them put scam in the backseat of the patrol car, obie gets rid of the gun and hides. he manages to subdue one of the officers and steals the car that scam is locked in the backseat in. after leading other officers on a chase through the city streets and down an alley, obie and scam manages to get away, but crashes the squad car in the process. they head to a diner where scam confesses to obie that his father isn't dead. according to scam's account of events, his father went south to look for work after his parents got divorced. scam's mother died 3 months previously while he was in her custody, which left him on his own and his father unaware of what happened. all that scam has of his father's is a driver's license, and vows to find him. at this point obie now considers scam his friend as he gets his bus and heads home. obie arrives home the next morning, and is visited by the police shortly after to find out what happened to him and where he was. obie lies, claiming he caught amnesia and does not remember. afterwards he has his mom take him to school, not wanting to tell her his bike was stolen. while at school obie finds it hard to concentrate. he starts thinking about scam, and decides that for all he has done for him he would pay him back by helping find his father. the next morning obie decides to steal the family jeep and drives off with his mother and sister chasing behind him. he returns to the hotel to look for scam, but finds out from miss hanks that a social worker had came and put scam in a home. obie visits the social worker and finds out where scam is. on his way back to the car, obie finds it swarmed with police looking for him. determined to help scam he gets the mercedes out of hiding and enlists the help of johnnie red. though hesitant at first, johnnie red agrees to help him. as they set out to get scam, someone spots the car and calls his friend, who then calls doc and dickie to claim the reward. obie and johnnie red arrive at the youth center where scam was placed. and with johnnie red passing himself off as his father they get scam out. obie then tells scam that his uncle harry works at the internal revenue service and with his help they will find his father. meanwhile doc and dickie head back to the bar to locate the car. doc attacks the bartender forcing him to give them a name, and he gives them johnnie red's name. after arriving back at johnnie red's place doc and dickie spot scam and obie, and they sneak up grabbing them from behind. as they are forcing them into a different car johnnie red walks up and stops them. after they flee, obie and scam head downtown to the irs office of obie's uncle. using the driver's license, they find that scam's dad lives in a town in louisiana, and the two set out on a road trip. but obie's uncle tells his mom where they are headed, causing her extreme worry. recalling that they bumped into the boys previously, doc and dickie revisit the hotel. they tie up miss hanks, and forces her to give up obie's full name. having traveled one hundred miles from the city obie and scam camp out for the night. after being scared awake by a stray cow the very next morning they get back on the road. back at the dawkins' residence doc and dickie manage to track down where obie lives. posing as chicago police officers they find out from obie's mom where they are headed. because the car is registered in doc's name both him and dickie are now more determined to catch the kids before they discover the body in the trunk, so they set out after them. when obie and scam get to missouri they pick up a hitchhiking bible salesman. he talks them into heading to a diner to get a bite to eat. at the diner he asks them to watch his suitcase while he goes to wash his hands, but scam is convinced that he is running a con on them. doc tells dickie to stop at the very same diner so that he may use the restroom. but dickie feeling that they are close keeps driving and passes the diner, all the while unaware that they just passed the car. the bible salesman is revealed to be a conman, just as scam suspected. he sneaks outside and steals the car, leaving obie and scam stranded at the diner. doc finally demands that dickie pull over so that he could urinate, with both of them unaware that the car is barreling down the road right behind them. when dickie hears a vehicle approaching he turns around and spots the mercedes. thinking its the kids both he and doc jump back in their car and give chase. but before they are able to catch up to their mercedes, a state trooper starts pursuing it. this forces doc and dickie break chase and decrease their speed. while the mercedes is pulled to the side of the road doc and dickie casually drive by, and they notice that its not the kids. the conman is arrested for speeding and the car is taken to the police station. doc and dickie tail the car to the station and hold up inside a diner across the street waiting for the right moment to retrieve it. meanwhile, obie and scam are aboard a bus heading towards their destination. due to the cost of the tickets they are down to their last $2. but when scam notices the conman being taken into police custody, he and obie spot the mercedes and tells the driver to stop so that they could get off. at the diner, doc and dickie are keeping a watchful eye on the car. dickie becomes very scared and nervous when an officer tries to open the trunk. fortunately for him and doc the officer was unsuccessful, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief. but taking their eyes off the mercedes for a few seconds allowed obie and scam to sneak up and regain the car. they drive off in the car with doc and dickie heading out right after them. doc and dickie catch up to the boys and starts ramming them to force them off the road, with doc firing gunshots at them. but good driving skills allowed obie and scam to evade their pursuers, leading them to splash in a watery ditch. realizing that their pursuers want the car back obie and scam take it to a dealership and trade it for another car. having traded the mercedes for an old beat up cadillac convertible, obie and scam make it to the town and address in louisiana. they go inside the house, only to learn that scam's dad has moved. as they are heading back to the car, they noticed that obie's mom has shown up accompanied by police officers. to avoid bumping into her both he and scam run out the backdoor. managing to avoid obie's mom they head into a bar to ask about scam's dad. the bartender makes a racist remark about scam's dad, leaving obie to tell him off with a few choice words before they both leave. overhearing their inquiry a waitress follows them outside to find out what they want with him. after scam tells her that the man their looking for is his dad she tells the two where they can find him. both obie and scam head back to the house, making sure that obie's mom has left. as they walk towards their car they are grabbed once again by doc and dickie. they take them back to the dealership where they traded the car. with dickie holding them captive doc attempts to take the car back from the car salesman at gun point. seeing an opening both obie and scam attack dickie, forcing him to break his grip on them, and the two are able to flee. running across the road, a semi-trailer truck swirves to avoid hitting them, causing the truck to crash into the cars on the lot. doc tries to run but falls in the process, and the chain reaction of crashes sets off an explosion that kills doc. obie and scam run away while other motorists spot dickie with a gun in hand. they subdue him and hold him at bay until police arrive. when the police are able to open the trunk of the mercedes, they discover the body of the man they killed. with doc dead, dickie tries to clear himself by pinning the actual murder on doc. plus he tells the police about the kids that stole the car. obie and scam reach a car ferry to take them across the river. but the ferryman  charges them $5.00, money that they do not have. rather than let scam give up, when they are so close to his dad, obie willingly gives his watch for payment. scam advises against the idea of obie handing over his dad's watch, but obie decides to give it as payment regardless. once on the ferry, the ferryman has a change of heart and decides to take them for free, thus giving obie his watch back. the two pull up to a factory where employees are leaving after their workday has ended. it is through the crowd where scam spot his dad. once his dad recognizes him they both run towards one another other, embracing each other with a hug. as obie watches this reunion of scam and his dad, he clinches his fist and lingers to the memory of his own father when he gave him his watch. seeing scam with his dad provides obie with some closure, thus allowing him to accept his father's death. and he unclinches his fist as a sign of him letting go of the sadness over his father's death. the movie ends with scam

       " \"aeneas leads escaped survivors of the trojan war to new land in italy. based on virgil's the aeneid.  in general, the avenger is a demythologized and condensed retelling of the second half of the aeneid. it is also insular in its storytelling, making none of the references to hannibal or caesar found in the aeneid. the movie differs from virgil's poem in many ways, but retains the same essential structure of books vii - xii. in virgil's aeneid, the story begins with juno provoking a storm that drives aeneas' ships to the carthage shores. the avenger begins after aeneas has arrived in italy, skipping the well-known substories of aeneas' affair with dido and his journey through the underworld. both stories recount the trojan war. in the aeneid, it is told by aeneas in dido's court; in the avenger it is told through a flashback while viewing a fresco in king latino's court. in the aeneid, gods and goddesses play a critical role in developing the plot, whereas in the avenger, there is little to no mention of the gods. throughout the aeneid, aeneas's mother venus actively protects him and advances his cause, while jupiter's wife juno actively opposes him and raises difficulties for him. jupiter, neptune, apollo, mercury and a host mythical creatures all make appearances as well. the movie borrows scenes from the poem, but often places them in a different context or reinterprets them with details altered. for example, in book v of the aeneid, the crew lands in the sicilian port eryx and is greeted by king acestes where they engage in a series of ceremonial games. one such game involves an archery contest where the target is a dove tied to a pole. in the aeneid, aeneas presides over the games , but in the avenger, king latino presides over the games while aeneas competes in them. in the aeneid, the first arrow strikes the pole, the second cuts the cord to the dove, while the third, delivered quickly after the second, catches the freed dove and brings it to the ground, winning the contest. although the contest has now been won, acestes shoots his bow anyway, and his arrow catches fire in the sky followed by a thunderbolt, which is interpreted as a great omen. in the avenger, the contest called for archery on horseback, there were multiple doves tied, and only two contestants: turno and camilla. camilla takes the first shot and misses, then is knocked off track by turno, who takes the second shot and hits the dove. he is awarded a prize, but the allegation that he played unfair causes him to challenge the audience, whereupon aeneas accepts the challenge and frees two doves with consecutive arrow shots. throughout the aeneid, not only the actions of the gods, but fate itself determines the outcome of events. this difference is highlighted by the titles: the aeneid, as the genitive case, translates as aeneas', referencing aeneas' destiny to settle italy, giving rise to a new race that will found rome and rule the world. it is unclear from the story why the film is called the avenger, as aeneas could be avenging aggression against the trojans by turno, or avenging the death of trojans in the war with the greeks.\",\n",
